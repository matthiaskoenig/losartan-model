TI  - Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 in 
      five ethnic populations of China.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Interethnic variability in drug pharmacokinetics is 
      well known. Our aim was to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of losartan 
      and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 vary between subjects of five 
      Chinese ethnicities (Han, Mongolian, Korean, Hui and Uigur). METHODS: Fifty 
      healthy subjects (five men and five women of each ethnicity) were recruited, and 
      each received 50-mg dose of losartan in tablet form. Fourteen blood samples were 
      collected for each subject over a 24-h period after drug administration. The 
      concentrations of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 in 
      plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence 
      (HPLC/FLU) method, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 2.0 
      software and compared by SPSS 16.0 software. Pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      including area under the curve from 0h to the last measured point 24h 
      [AUC((0-24))], area under the curve from 0h to infinite time [AUC((0-∞))], peak 
      plasma concentration (C(max) ), time to reach C(max) (t(max) ), oral clearance 
      (CL), oral volume of distribution (V(d)) and elimination half-life (t(1/2) ), 
      were determined following a single oral dose of losartan. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 
      The t(1/2) values of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 
      showed significant differences across the five ethnicities. After normalization 
      by weight, no ethnicity-based difference was noted in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of losartan. However, there were significant differences in C(max) and 
      V(d) of the active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 for Han and Mongolian 
      subjects, compared with the other three ethnic groups. There was a high linear 
      correlation between weight and C(max) , AUC((0-24)) , AUC((0-∞)) , CL and V(d) . 
      WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Ethnicity was associated with significant differences 
      in the single-dose pharmacokinetics of losartan's active carboxylic acid 
      metabolite E-3174 in healthy subjects of the five main ethnic groups in China.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite, EXP3174, after intravenous and 
      oral administration of losartan to rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 147-58
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, EXP3174, were 
      investigated after intravenous and oral administration of the drug, 5 mg/kg, to 
      control rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus rats (SIDRs). After 
      1-min intravenous infusion, the mean arterial plasma concentrations and the 
      resultant area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity 
      (AUC) of both losartan and EXP3174 were not significantly different between 
      control rats and the SIDRs. However, the renal clearance (CLR) of losartan (0.181 
      versus 0.0815 ml/min/kg) and EXP3174 (0.0677 versus 0.0277 ml/min/kg) were 
      significantly faster in SIDRs than in control rats due to significant increase in 
      glomerular filtration rate. After oral administration, the mean arterial plasma 
      concentrations and the resultant AUC of losartan (97 versus 166 micrograms 
      min/ml) and EXP3174 (244 versus 423 micrograms min/ml) were significantly lower 
      in SIDRs than in control rats. The absolute extent of oral bioavailability of 
      losartan, F, (32.5 versus 55.1%) decreased considerably in SIDRs and it was 
      possibly due to the reduced gastrointestinal absorption of losartan by 
      gastrointestinal disorders occurring in the diabetic state. The low F in both 
      groups of rats was at least partially due to the increase in first-pass effects. 
      The CLR of losartan (0.207 versus 0.101 ml/min/kg) and EXP3174 (0.0615 versus 
      0.0196 ml/min/kg) were significantly faster in SIDRs than in control rats after 
      oral administration of losartan.

TI  - Effects of erythromycin or rifampin on losartan pharmacokinetics in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 316-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, 
      E3174, which has greater antihypertensive activity than the parent compound. 
      Coadministered drugs that inhibit or induce metabolic processes may therefore 
      alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic response of losartan and E3174. 
      OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were studied to assess the effects 
      of CYP3A4 inhibition and nonspecific P450 enzyme induction on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174. Subjects completed three 1-week phases 
      separated by 6 days: 50 mg losartan every morning, losartan plus 500 mg 
      erythromycin four times a day, and losartan plus 300 mg rifampin (INN, 
      rifampicin) twice a day. On the eighth day of each phase, serial plasma 
      concentrations of losartan and E3174 were obtained over 32 hours and steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics were determined. RESULTS: Rifampin decreased the area under the 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours after the dose (AUC[0-24]) of 
      losartan by 35% (349 +/- 246 versus 225 +/- 130; p = 0.0001) and decreased the 
      AUC(0-24) of E3174 by 40% (1336 +/- 445 versus 792 +/- 302; p < 0.005). Losartan 
      oral clearance was increased by 44% (p = 0.0001). The half-life values of both 
      compounds were decreased by 50% (p < 0.005). In contrast, erythromycin did not 
      significantly affect the AUC(0-24) or half-life of either losartan or E3174. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rifampin is a potent inducer of losartan and E3174 elimination. 
      Given the magnitude of the effect, this interaction is likely to be clinically 
      significant. On the basis of the minimal inhibitory effects observed with 
      erythromycin, CYP3A4 appears to play a minor role in the in vivo metabolism of 
      losartan to E3174. Further studies are needed to define the contribution of other 
      isozymes, particularly CYP2C9, to the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174.

TI  - Effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of eprosartan and losartan in 
      healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 417-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of steady-state fluconazole administration 
      on the disposition of eprosartan, losartan, and E-3174. METHODS: Sixteen healthy 
      male subjects received 300 mg eprosartan every 12 hours, and 16 received 100 mg 
      losartan every 24 hours on study days 1 to 20. All 32 subjects received 200 mg 
      fluconazole every 24 hours beginning on day 11 and continuing through day 20. 
      Serial blood samples were collected over one dosing interval on study days 10 and 
      20 for measurement of plasma concentrations of eprosartan, losartan, and E-3174 
      (the active metabolite of losartan). RESULTS: There was no significant difference 
      in eprosartan area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of last 
      quantifiable concentration [AUC(0-t)] or maximum concentration (Cmax) when 
      administered alone and with fluconazole. After concomitant administration with 
      fluconazole, losartan AUC(0-t) and Cmax were significantly increased 66% and 30%, 
      respectively, compared with those values for losartan alone. The AUC(0-t) and 
      Cmax for E-3174 were significantly decreased 43% and 56%, respectively, after 
      administration of losartan with fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole 
      significantly increases the steady-state AUC of losartan and inhibits the 
      formation of the active metabolite of losartan, E-3174. In contrast, fluconazole 
      administration has no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of eprosartan.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence evaluation of two losartan potassium 50-mg 
      tablets: A single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-way crossover study 
      in healthy Chinese male volunteers.
PG  - 1387-95
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.06.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist used as 
      an antihypertensive agent. The relative bioavailability of a newly developed 
      tablet compared with an established branded formulation has not been reported in 
      a Chinese population. OBJECTIVE: To meet the requirements for marketing a new 
      generic product, the study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters 
      and relative bioavailability of a new generic losartan potassium 50-mg tablet 
      (test formulation) with a branded 50-mg tablet (reference formulation) in healthy 
      Chinese male volunteers. METHODS: A single-dose, randomized-sequence, openlabel, 
      2-way crossover study was conducted in healthy Chinese male volunteers. Eligible 
      participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 50-mg 
      tablet of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 1-week washout period 
      and then administration of the alternate formulation. The study drugs were 
      administered after a 10-hour overnight fast. Plasma samples were collected over 
      36 hours. Tolerability was evaluated by recording adverse events (AEs) and 
      monitoring vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory tests at baseline and at completion 
      of the study. Plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite 
      (EXP3174) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including 
      C(max), AUC(0-36), and AUC(0-infinity), were calculated. If the 90% CIs for the 
      log-transformed values of AUC were within 80% to 125%, and that of C(max) was 
      within 70% to 143%, the 2 products would be considered bioequivalent according to 
      the guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration and the State Food and Drug 
      Administration of China. RESULTS: Twenty-seven healthy Chinese male volunteers 
      participated in this study (mean [SD] age, 24.5 [2.3] years [range, 20-29 years]; 
      weight, 64.6 [4.0] kg [range, 60.0-75.0 kg]; height, 172.2 [4.8] cm [range, 
      165.0183.0 cm]; and body mass index, 21.8 [1.2] kg/m(2) [range, 20.0-25.0 
      kg/m(2)]). One volunteer (3.7%) experienced an AE (microscopic hematuria) after 
      administration of the test formulation. This resolved spontaneously after 10 days 
      and was considered by the investigator as mild; the relationship with the study 
      drug was uncertain. No serious AEs were reported. Both formulations were 
      associated with significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      and significant increases in heart rate compared with baseline values (all, P < 
      0.05). No period, formulation, or sequence effects were observed for any 
      pharmacokinetic parameter, except for a significant subject effect. For parent 
      losartan, the 90% CIs for the ratios (test/reference) of C(max), AUC(0-36), and 
      AUCAUC(0-infinity) were 83.65% to 113.36%, 89.79% to 98.25%, and 90.95% to 
      99.55%, respectively. For the metabolite EXP3174, the 90% CIs for the ratios of 
      C(max), AUC(0-36), and AUCAUC(0-infinity) were 93.49% to 103.61%, 96.79% to 
      104.09%, and 97.06% to 105.83%. Both C(max) and AUC met the predetermined 
      criteria for assuming bioequivalence. The relative bioavailability of the test 
      formulation to the reference formulation was 93.92% for losartan and 100.40% for 
      EXP3174. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in healthy Chinese male volunteers, a 
      single 50-mg oral dose of a losartan potassium tablet (test formulation) met the 
      regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to the established reference 
      formulation. Both formulations were well tolerated.

TI  - Effect of soy extract administration on losartan pharmacokinetics in healthy 
      female volunteers.
PG  - 1045-9
LID - 10.1345/aph.1L690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: osartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, 
      E-3174, which has greater antihypertensive activity than the parent compound. Soy 
      extract has been shown to be an activator of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in vitro. 
      Coadministration of soy extract and losartan may therefore alter the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether, when 
      losartan was used in combination with soy extract, a significant pharmacokinetic 
      interaction would be observed in healthy female volunteers. METHODS: Eighteen 
      healthy Chinese female volunteers were recruited. In an open-label, 2-phase 
      study, losartan 50 mg was given to each subject, with and without soy extract. 
      Plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174 were determined by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 12 and 24 hours, respectively. On day 
      8 through day 21 of the study, following a 7-day washout period, each subject 
      consumed two 1000-mg Genistein Soy Complex tablets orally after meals, twice 
      daily, for 14 days. On day 22, all volunteers received losartan 50 mg and blood 
      samples were collected again. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, without 
      adverse drug effects. Over the 14-day pretreatment period, soy extract did not 
      significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174. The ratio of 
      the area under the curve of the drug and metabolite after losartan 
      administration, with and without soy extract ingestion, was 0.21 +/- 0.05 and 
      0.23 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD), respectively. The difference was not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a significant 
      interaction between soy extract and losartan is unlikely to occur in females.

PG  - 723-8
AB  - The bioavailability of a new losartan preparation 
      (2-butyl-4-chloro-1-[p-(o-1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]imidazole-5-methanol 
      monopotassium salt, CAS 114798-26-4) was compared with the reference preparation 
      of the drug in 24 healthy male volunteers, aged between 19 and 32. The open, 
      randomized, single-blind two-sequence, two-period crossover study design was 
      performed. Under fasting conditions, each subject received a single oral dose of 
      100 mg losartan as a test or reference formulation. The plasma concentrations of 
      losartan and its active metabolite were analyzed by a rapid and sensitive HPLC 
      method with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters included AUC0-36h, 
      AUC0-infinity, Cmax, t1/2, and Ke. Values of AUC0-infinity demonstrate nearly 
      identical bioavailability of losartan from the examined formulations. The 
      AUC0-infinity of losartan was 2019.92+/-1002.90 and 2028.58+/-837.45 ng x h/ml 
      for the test and reference formulation, respectively. The AUC0-infinity of the 
      metabolite was 10851.52+/-4438.66 and 11041.18 +/-5015.81 ng x h/ml for test and 
      reference formulation, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
      losartan was 745.94+/-419.75 ng/ml for the test and 745.74+/-329.99 ng/ml for the 
      reference product and the Cmax of the metabolite was 1805.77+/-765.39 and 1606.22 
      +/-977.22 ng/ml for the test and reference product, respectively. No statistical 
      differences were observed for Cmax and the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve for both losartan and its active metabolite. 90 % 
      confidence limits calculated for Cmax and AUC from zero to infinity 
      (AUC0-infinity) of losartan and its metabolite were included in the 
      bioequivalence range (0.8-1.25 for AUC). This study shows that the test 
      formulation is bioequivalent to the reference formulation for losartan and its 
      main active metabolite.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of losartan in renal insufficiency.
PG  - S49-52
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of losartan (MK-954) and its metabolite E3174. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A two-center, unblinded trial was performed in 18 patients (age range 
      31-63 years) with various degrees of renal function grouped according to the 
      renal clearance of creatinine: group I, creatinine clearance > or = 75 ml/min; 
      group II, creatinine clearance 30-74 ml/min; group III, creatinine clearance 
      10-29 ml/min (n = 6 in all groups). Losartan (100 mg/day) was administered under 
      supervised conditions for seven consecutive days. Plasma samples were taken for 
      up to 60 h and 24-h urine collections were made following the final dose of 
      losartan (on day 7) to determine losartan and E3174 concentrations, with 
      simultaneous measurements of blood pressure and the pulse rate. RESULTS: The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for losartan and E3174 changed inconsequentially 
      across the range of renal insufficiency. For losartan, renal clearance decreased 
      from 50 +/- 19 ml/min in group I to 2.3 +/- 0.9 ml/min in group III (P < 0.05). 
      For E3174, although the renal clearance decreased from 16 +/- 4.1 ml/min in group 
      I to 1.3 +/- 0.8 ml/min in group III (P < 0.05), the area under the plasma 
      concentration curve did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The steady-state areas under the 
      curve of losartan and E3174 are not significantly changed with renal impairment. 
      The renal clearance of losartan decreases with renal impairment but since only a 
      small percentage of the dose is ordinarily eliminated by the kidney, the 
      demonstrated reduction in clearance is clinically irrelevant. The renal clearance 
      of E3174 also decreases with renal impairment, but the steady-state area under 
      the curve does not increase with increasing degrees of renal insufficiency. These 
      pharmacokinetic alterations do not warrant dose adjustment in the face of renal 
      insufficiency.

TI  - Effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      its main metabolite EXP-3174 in rats: possible role of CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition 
      by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1159/000328773 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the effects of 
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors 
      (atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      its active metabolite EXP-3174 in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan 
      and EXP-3174 in rats were determined after oral and intravenous administration of 
      losartan (9 mg/kg) without and with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (1 mg/kg). The 
      effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on P-gp and cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 activity 
      were also evaluated. Atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin inhibited CYP3A4 
      activities with IC₅₀ values of 48.0, 14.1 and 3.10 μmol/l, respectively. 
      Simvastatin (1-10 μmol/l) enhanced the cellular uptake of rhodamine-123 in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. The area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC₀₋∞) and the peak plasma concentration of losartan were significantly 
      (p < 0.05) increased by 59.6 and 45.8%, respectively, by simvastatin compared to 
      those of control. The total body clearance (CL/F) of losartan after oral 
      administration with simvastatin was significantly decreased (by 34.8%) compared 
      to that of controls. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (F) of losartan 
      after oral administration with simvastatin was significantly increased by 59.4% 
      compared to that of control. The metabolite-parent AUC ratio was significantly 
      decreased by 25.7%, suggesting that metabolism of losartan was inhibited by 
      simvastatin. In conclusion, the enhanced bioavailability of losartan might be 
      mainly due to inhibition of P-gp in the small intestine and CYP3A 
      subfamily-mediated metabolism of losartan in the small intestine and/or liver and 
      to reduction of the CL/F of losartan by simvastatin.

TI  - Comparison of Pharmacokinetics of a Fixed-Dose Combination of 
      Amlodipine/Losartan/Rosuvastatin with Concomitant Administration of 
      Amlodipine/Losartan and Rosuvastatin in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 661-668
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S233014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet formulation of 
      amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin 5/100/20 mg was developed to improve medication 
      compliance in patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia. The comparative 
      pharmacokinetic study was performed to compare the profile of an FDC tablet 
      formulation of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin with that of concomitant 
      administration of a currently marketed FDC tablet of amlodipine/losartan with a 
      rosuvastatin tablet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, single oral 
      dose, two-way crossover study was conducted in 60 healthy subjects. Subjects were 
      orally administered the FDC tablet of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin and a 
      loose combination (LC) of two tablets comprising an FDC of amlodipine/losartan 
      and rosuvastatin. Blood samples were collected for up to 144 h post dose for 
      pharmacokinetic evaluations. Plasma concentrations of amlodipine, losartan, 
      EXP3174 (an active metabolite of losartan), and rosuvastatin were measured by 
      using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The geometric mean ratio 
      (GMR) and its 90% confidence interval (90% CI) in the FDC treatment to LC 
      treatment for the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to the last 
      quantifiable time point (AUC(last)) and the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      were calculated. Safety was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: The GMR (90% 
      CI) values of AUC(last) and C(max) were 0.9946 (0.9663-1.0238) and 0.9690 
      (0.9379-1.0011) for amlodipine, 0.9855 (0.9422-1.0308) and 0.9178 (0.8349-1.0089) 
      for losartan, 0.9814 (0.9501-1.0136) and 0.9756 (0.9313-1.0219) for EXP3174, and 
      0.9448 (0.8995-0.9923) and 0.9609 (0.8799-1.0494) for rosuvastatin, respectively. 
      No clinically significant changes were observed in any of the safety parameters, 
      including clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and 
      physical examinations, between the FDC treatment and the LC treatment. 
      CONCLUSION: We confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the FDC and LC 
      treatments. This triple combination FDC formulation could be a clinically useful 
      replacement for LC therapy.

TI  - Effects of ticlopidine on pharmacokinetics of losartan and its main metabolite 
      EXP-3174 in rats.
PG  - 967-72
LID - 10.1038/aps.2011.32 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Losartan and antiplatelet agent ticlopidine can be prescribed concomitantly 
      for prevention or therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the effects of 
      ticlopidine on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite 
      EXP-3174 were evaluated in rats. METHODS: Ticlopidine (4 or 10 mg/kg po) was 
      administered 30 min before administration of losartan (9 mg/kg po or 3 mg/kg iv). 
      The activity of human CYP2C9 and 3A4 were measured using the CYP inhibition assay 
      kit. The activity of P-gp was evaluated using rhodamine-123 retention assay in 
      MCF-7/ADR cells. RESULTS: Ticlopidine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the 
      areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) of oral losartan (9 mg/kg), as well as the AUCs of the 
      active metabolite EXP-3174. Ticlopidine (10 mg/kg) did not significantly change 
      the pharmacokinetics of intravenous losartan (3 mg/kg). Ticlopidine inhibited 
      CYP2C9 and 3A4 with IC₅₀ values of 26.0 and 32.3 μmol/L, respectively. The 
      relative cellular uptake of rhodamine-123 was unchanged. CONCLUSION: The 
      significant increase in the AUC of losartan (9 mg/kg) by ticlopidine (10 mg/kg) 
      could be attributed to the inhibition of CYP2C9- and 3A4-mediated losartan 
      metabolism in small intestine and/or in liver. The inhibition of P-gp in small 
      intestine and reduction of renal elimination of losartan by ticlopidine are 
      unlikely to be causal factors.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral losartan in patients with heart failure.
PG  - 525-32
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of a selective AT1-subtype, nonpeptide, orally active, 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, were characterized in 11 patients 
      with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II, n = 6; class III, n = 4; 
      class IV, n = 1) after oral and intravenous administration. In these patients, 
      average plasma clearance of losartan was 566 mL/min, volume of distribution at 
      steady-state was 34 L, and terminal plasma half-life was 1.5 hours. Average 
      bioavailability was 36%. No clinically significant accumulation of losartan or 
      its active metabolite, EXP3174, occurred after multiple-dose oral administration 
      for 7 to 8 days. Terminal plasma half-life of EXP3174 after oral administration 
      of losartan was 7.6 hours. The pharmacokinetics of losartan in patients in this 
      study appear to be similar to those in healthy subjects studied previously.

PG  - 641-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan potassium 
      and its active carboxylic acid metabolite EXP3174 were characterized in 18 
      healthy male subjects after administration of intravenous losartan, intravenous 
      EXP3174, and oral losartan. In these subjects, the average plasma clearance of 
      losartan was 610 ml/min, and the volume of distribution was 34 L. Renal clearance 
      (70 ml/min) accounted for 12% of plasma clearance. Terminal half-life was 2.1 
      hours. In contrast, the average plasma clearance of EXP3174 was 47 ml/min, and 
      its volume of distribution was 10 L. Renal clearance was 26 ml/min, which 
      accounted for 55% of plasma clearance; terminal half-life was 6.3 hours. After 
      oral administration of losartan, peak concentrations of losartan were reached in 
      1 hour. Peak concentrations of EXP3174 were reached in 3 1/2 hours. The area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve of EXP3174 was about four times that of 
      losartan. The oral bioavailability of losartan tablets was 33%. The low 
      bioavailability was mainly attributable to first-pass metabolism. After 
      intravenous or oral administration of losartan the conversion of losartan to the 
      metabolite EXP3174 was 14%.

PG  - 62-6
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and biochemical efficacy of losartan, an orally active 
      nonpeptide angiotensin II (A II)-receptor antagonist, were studied in healthy 
      male volunteers after single oral dose administration (25, 50, 100, or 200 mg) 
      and multiple oral dose administration (100 mg or placebo once a day for 7 days). 
      Plasma and urinary concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, 
      were determined. The mean Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) values increased in 
      a dose-dependent manner. The terminal half-life of losartan ranged from 1.5 to 
      2.5 hours. Plasma concentration of E-3174 was higher than that of losartan at all 
      dose levels. The Cmax and AUC values for E-3174 were approximately two and five 
      to eight times higher than those for losartan, respectively. Furthermore, the 
      half-life of E-3174 was two times that of losartan. After multiple dosing for 7 
      days, the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174 did not change significantly 
      between day 1 and day 7. Plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of A II 
      increased at all dose levels. Plasma aldosterone levels were slightly reduced, 
      but a similar decrease was also observed with placebo. The urinary excretion of 
      uric acid within the first 4 hours after treatment was also increased in a 
      dose-dependent manner, whereas the urinary excretion of creatinine remained 
      unchanged. In other pharmacokinetic studies, it has been reported that 
      bioavailability of losartan is about 33%, and its absorption is excellent. The 
      metabolite is excreted via urine and the bile. Based on our observations, the 
      half-life and plasma concentrations of E-3174 were greater than those of 
      losartan. In conclusion, the long-lasting blocking effect of losartan on A II 
      action can be attributed to the plasma levels of its active metabolite, E-3174.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan and its active metabolite, 
      E-3174, were studied in 8 stable, hypertensive continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) patients. Following a 1-week washout period, subjects received 
      100 mg of losartan orally for 7 days. On Days 1 and 7, hemodynamic and hormonal 
      responses were determined, as were PK parameters on Day 7. Peritoneal 
      equilibration testing was performed pre-Day 1 and on Day 7. AUC0-24 and t1/2 for 
      losartan and E-3174 were 95 +/- 49.9 micrograms.min/mL and 176 +/- 82.1 
      micrograms.min/mL and 172.5 +/- 86.7 minutes and 628 +/- 575 minutes, 
      respectively. These values are similar to those of normal subjects and subjects 
      on hemodialysis. Peritoneal clearance of losartan and E-3174 was negligible. All 
      subjects demonstrated a substantial reduction in blood pressure with at least a 
      10 mmHg drop in diastolic BP. Plasma renin activity (PRA) values increased, but 
      aldosterone, endothelin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine values did not change 
      following 7 days of losartan. Losartan was well tolerated in all study subjects.

TI  - The effects of fluvastatin, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, on losartan pharmacokinetics in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 418-24
AB  - Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that is metabolized by CYP2C9 
      and CYP3A4 to a more potent antihypertensive metabolite, E3174. Interaction 
      studies with inhibitors of CYP3A4 have not demonstrated significant changes in 
      the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E3174. The authors assessed the steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174 when administered alone and concomitantly 
      with fluvastatin, a specific CYP2C9 inhibitor. A prospective, open-label, 
      crossover study was conducted in 12 healthy volunteers with losartan alone and in 
      combination with fluvastatin. The baseline phase was 7 days of losartan (50 mg 
      QAM), and the inhibition phase was 14 total days of fluvastatin (40 mg QHS), with 
      the final 7 days including losartan. The authors found that fluvastatin did not 
      significantly change the steady-state AUC0-24 or half-life of losartan or E3174. 
      Losartan apparent oral clearance was not affected by fluvastatin. Inhibition of 
      losartan metabolism appears to require both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibition.

AB  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective and well-tolerated orally 
      active anti-hypertensive agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of typical ARBs in the dog. 60 beagles were 
      administered a single oral dose of Micardis® 80 mg (telmisartan), Cozaar® 50 mg 
      (losartan), or Diovan® 80- and 160-mg (valsartan). The plasma concentrations of 
      these ARBs were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and 
      their pharmacokinetic properties were analyzed using both non-compartmental and 
      compartmental approaches. The half-life and volume of distribution in dogs were 
      in the order losartan>valsartan>telmisartan after oral administration. Systemic 
      exposure was estimated by calculating the area under the plasma 
      concentration-vs.-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC inf ), and resulted 
      in the order telmisartan>valsartan>losartan. The values of C max and AUC 
      increased in proportion to the dose of valsartan. In compartmental analysis, the 
      pharmacokinetics of telmisartan and losartan pharmacokinetics fit a 2-compartment 
      model, while valsartan fit a 1-compartment model. These results provide detailed 
      pharmacokinetic information of ARBs in the dog, and may aid in future development 
      of improved formulations or fixed-dose combinations.

TI  - Determinants of steady-state torasemide pharmacokinetics: impact of 
      pharmacogenetic factors, gender and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
PG  - 323-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torasemide is frequently used for the treatment of hypertension and 
      heart failure. However, the determinants of torasemide pharmacokinetics in 
      patients during steady-state conditions are largely unknown. We therefore 
      explored the impact of genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 
      (CYP2C9) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (SLCO1B1), gender, 
      and the effects of losartan and irbesartan comedication on the interindividual 
      variability of steady-state pharmacokinetics of torasemide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Twenty-four patients receiving stable medication with torasemide 10 mg once daily 
      and with an indication for additional angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) 
      treatment to control hypertension or to treat heart failure were selected. Blood 
      samples were taken before torasemide administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 
      24 hours after administration. After this first study period, patients received 
      either irbesartan 150 mg (five female and seven male patients aged 69+/-8 years) 
      or losartan 100 mg (two female and ten male patients aged 61+/-8 years) once 
      daily. After 3 days of ARB medication, eight blood samples were again collected 
      at the timepoints indicated above. The patients' long-term medications, which did 
      not include known CYP2C9 inhibitors, were maintained at a constant dose during 
      the study. All patients were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*1/*1 [n=15]; *1/*2 [n = 4]; 
      *1/*3 [n=5]) as well as for SLCO1B1 (c.521TT [n=13]; c.521TC [n=11]). RESULTS: 
      Factorial ANOVA revealed an independent impact of the CYP2C9 genotype 
      (dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the 
      24-hour dosing interval at steady state [AUC(24,ss)/D]: *1/*1 375.5+/-151.4 
      microg x h/L/mg vs *1/*3 548.5+/-271.6 microg x h/L/mg, p=0.001), the SLCO1B1 
      genotype (AUC(24,ss)/D: TT 352.3+/-114 microg x h/L/mg vs TC 487.6+/-218.4 microg 
      x h/L/mg, p<0.05) and gender (AUC(24,ss)/D: males 359.5+/-72.2 microg x h/L/mg vs 
      females 547.3+/-284 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.01) on disposition of torasemide. 
      Coadministration of irbesartan caused a 13% increase in the AUC(24,ss)/D of 
      torasemide (p=0.002), whereas losartan had no effect. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that the CYP2C9*3 and SLCO1B1 c.521TC genotype and female gender are 
      significant and independent predictors of the pharmacokinetics of torasemide. 
      Coadministration of irbesartan yields moderate but significant increases in the 
      torasemide plasma concentration and elimination half-life.

TI  - The influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and losartan after 
      single-dose of its compound tablets in healthy chinese subjects.
PG  - 229-35
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1357143 [doi]
AB  - We aim to identify the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      amlodipine, losartan and losartan's active metabolite (EXP3174) after oral 
      administration of the Compound Amlodipine Tablets with single dose in healthy 
      Chinese subjects. 12 subjects took the compounds (10 mg/100 mg, 
      amlodipine/losartan) at the conditions of a high-fat breakfast and an overnight 
      fast with a washout period of 14 days. Plasma samples were obtained at scheduled 
      time, and determined by HPLC-MS/MS for the concentrations of amlodipine and 
      HPLC-MS for the concentrations of losartan and EXP3174, respectively. PK 
      parameters were calculated using Software Drug and Statistics (Version 2.0). When 
      tablets were co-administered with food, there was no significant difference of 
      AUC for amlodipine and losartan, but the AUC of EXP3174 was reduced by 19.1%. 
      Meanwhile, the Cmax of amlodipine, losartan and EXP3174 were reduced by 11.4%, 
      20.0% and 41.4%, and the Tmax of losartan and EXP3174 were 1.3 and 1.8 h longer, 
      respectively. No significant difference was found at t1/2 following food intake. 
      In conclusion, the Compound Amlodipine Tablets, are affected by food 
      administration by reducing the AUC of EXP3174. It is thus suggested that the 
      Compound Amlodipine Tablets should be administered 1 h before or 2 h after meal.

TI  - The effect of AST-120 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      losartan acid (E-3174) in healthy subjects.
PG  - 310-20
AB  - AST-120 is an orally administered adsorbent used to slow the progression of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). This was a randomized, open-label, 5-way crossover 
      study to assess the effect of AST-120 on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite (E-3174) in healthy subjects. Losartan (100 mg) was 
      administered alone under fasting (A) and fed (B) conditions, and results were 
      compared when AST-120 (3 g thrice daily for 2 days) was administered 60 minutes 
      after (C), 30 minutes prior to (D), and 30 minutes after (E) losartan. Plasma 
      concentrations of losartan and E-3174 were assayed by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Under fed conditions, treatment 
      C had no significant effect on the AUC(0-t) and Cmax of losartan and E-3174. 
      Treatments D and E resulted in a marked decrease in Cmax of losartan and E-3174. 
      Therefore, administration of AST-120 60 minutes after losartan under fed 
      conditions may be preferred over other dosing regimens for CKD patients.

TI  - Comparative bioavailability of two losartan formulations in healthy human 
      volunteers after a single dose administration.
PG  - 142-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the bioavailability of two potassic losartan immediate 
      release tablet (50 mg) formulations (Losartan from Laboratórios Cristália Ltd., 
      Brazil, as a test formulation and Cozaar from Merck Sharp & Dohme Farmacêutica 
      Ltd., Brazil, as a reference formulation) in 25 volunteers of both sexes. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in an open, randomized, 2-period 
      crossover design and a 1-week washout period. Plasma samples were obtained over a 
      24-hour interval. The concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite 
      losartan acid were analyzed by combined reversed phase liquid chromatography and 
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) with negative ion electrospray ionization 
      using a selected ion monitoring method. From the losartan and losartan acid 
      plasma concentrations vs. time curves the following pharmacokinetic parameters 
      were obtained: AUClast, AUC0-inf and Cmax. RESULTS: The geometric mean and 
      respective 90% confidence interval (CI) of Losartan/Cozaar losartan percent 
      ratios were 92.9% (82.2-105.0%) for Cmax, 99.0% (92.5-105.9%) for AUClast, and 
      99.1% (92.7-105.8%) for AUC0-inf. Furthermore, the geometric mean and respective 
      90% CI of Losartan/Cozaar losartan acid percent ratios were 98.5% (91.5-106.0%) 
      for Cmax, 97.9% (93.3 102.7%) for AUClast, and 98.1% (93.6-102.9%) for AUC0-inf. 
      CONCLUSION: Since the 90% CI for Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-inf were within the 
      80-125% interval proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration, it was 
      concluded that the potassic losartan immediate release 50 mg tablet was 
      bioequivalent to the Cozaar immediate release 50 mg tablet, according to both the 
      rate and extent of absorption. While there were no significant differences in the 
      bioequivalence assessed by either losartan or losartan acid, future 
      bioequivalence studies on losartan may be performed by quantifying losartan alone 
      as the parent compounds are more discriminative.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Amlodipine/Losartan and 
      Chlorthalidone Compared to Concurrent Administration of the Separate Components.
PG  - 91-99
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.963 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is more effectively treated with coadministration of 2 or more 
      antihypertensive drugs than with high-dose monotherapy. Therefore, calcium 
      channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and thiazides are 
      coadministered to treat hypertension. The objective of this study was to compare 
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of HCP1401, a fixed-dose combination of 
      amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and chlorthalidone 25 mg, with the separate 
      components (loose combination) of amlodipine/losartan 5/100 mg and chlorthalidone 
      25 mg. A randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover study was 
      conducted. Blood samples for amlodipine and chlorthalidone were collected for up 
      to 144 hours after dosing, whereas those for losartan were collected up to 48 
      hours after dosing. The PK parameters of these drugs were calculated using a 
      noncompartmental method. Sixty subjects completed the study. The geometric mean 
      ratios and 90% confidence intervals of maximum plasma concentration and area 
      under the concentration-time curve to the last measurable point for amlodipine, 
      losartan, and chlorthalidone were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 
      0.80 to 1.25. There were no clinically significant changes in safety assessments, 
      and the treatments were well tolerated. The PK characteristics and tolerability 
      profiles of a single oral FDC of amlodipine, losartan, and chlorthalidone were 
      equivalent to those of individual tablets in a loose combination.

      male subjects.
PG  - 788-93
LID - 10.1080/00498250903134435 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of losartan in 
      relation to the CYP2C9*13 allele. A single oral dose of 50 mg losartan was 
      administrated to each of the 16 healthy male volunteers with a different genotype 
      (CYP2C9*1/*1, n = 6; CYP2C9*1/*13, n = 4; and CYP2C9*1/*3, n = 6). Blood samples 
      were collected from pre-dose up to 24 h after the drug administration. Plasma 
      losartan and E3174 (an active metabolite of losartan) were assayed by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All the subjects finished the 
      study without adverse drug effects. In the present study, the frequencies of 
      CYP2C9*13 and *13 alleles were 0.6% and 2.6% in Chinese healthy volunteers, 
      respectively, and both alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with 
      the subjects in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group, individuals carrying the CYP2C9*1/*13 
      genotype showed significantly a longer t(1/2) of losartan and E3174 and markedly 
      increased the area under the curve (AUC) of losartan. Meanwhile, the CYP2C9*1/*3 
      genotype group had significant differences in t(1/2) and Cmax of E3174 compared 
      with the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The ratio of AUC(E3174)/AUC(losartan) after losartan 
      administration in the CYP2C9*1/*13 and CYP2C9*1/*3 groups was also statistically 
      different from that in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The data indicate that the presence 
      of the CYP2C9*13 allele results in poor metabolism of losartan after a single 
      oral dose.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and biochemical efficacy after single and multiple oral 
      administration of losartan, an orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, in humans.
PG  - 290-7
AB  - 1. The pharmacokinetics and biochemical efficacy of losartan, an orally active 
      nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, were evaluated in healthy 
      male volunteers after single and multiple oral administration. 2. Plasma and 
      urinary concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, were 
      determined by a specific high performance liquid chromatographic (h.p.l.c.) 
      method. 3. Plasma concentrations of losartan were proportional to dose over the 
      range of 25 to 200 mg and the terminal half-lives (t1/2,z) ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 
      h. The mean values of Cmax and AUC0-infinity increased in a dose-dependent 
      manner. 4. Plasma concentrations of E-3174 were higher than those of losartan at 
      all dose levels. The values of Cmax and AUC0-infinity for E-3174 were 
      approximately 2 and 5-8 times higher than those for losartan, respectively. Also 
      the value of t1/2,z was 2 times longer than that of losartan. 5. After multiple 
      dosing for 7 days, the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 each did not 
      change significantly between day 1 and day 7. 6. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and 
      plasma concentrations of AII increased markedly at all dose levels. Plasma 
      aldosterone levels were slightly reduced, but a similar decrease was also 
      observed with placebo. 7. No clinically significant adverse reaction was observed 
      in any of the volunteers during either study. Blood counts, routine laboratory 
      tests, urine analyses, and electrocardiograms were also not modified by losartan. 
      8. Losartan appears to be a potent orally active angiotensin II antagonist with a 
      relatively long duration of action.

TI  - The physicochemical properties, in vitro metabolism and pharmacokinetics of a 
      novel ester prodrug of EXP3174.
PG  - 2132-40
LID - 10.1021/mp100166c [doi]
AB  - EXP3174 is the major active metabolite of losartan, a drug currently widely used 
      for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to evaluate 
      the physicochemical properties of EXP3174-pivoxil (a novel synthesized prodrug of 
      EXP3174) and characterize its metabolism, regional intestinal absorption and 
      pharmacokinetics by in vitro and in vivo studies. An in vitro metabolism study 
      was conducted in liver and intestinal S9 fractions from different species 
      including rat, dog and human. In vivo absorption was investigated following 
      regional intestinal dosing in rats, and the pharmacokinetics was determined using 
      rats after a single oral administration. EXP3174-pivoxil exhibited predictable 
      stability in the aqueous solution within a pH range of 1.2-9.0 as well as in the 
      solid form of powder. An in vitro metabolism study revealed that EXP3174-pivoxil 
      was rapidly and efficiently converted into EXP3174 by enzymatic hydrolysis. The 
      dose administered into the duodenum and jejunum resulted in higher values for the 
      AUC(0-24h) and C(max) than those following ileum dosing (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 
      the AUC(0-24h) and C(max) values for EXP3174 increased in a dose-dependent manner 
      as dose increased from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg. A comparable AUC(0-24h), shortened T(max) 
      and a significant increase in the plasma C(max) of EXP3174 were observed 
      following oral administration of EXP3174-pivoxil (as EXP3174, 1 mg/kg) compared 
      with those of losartan (as EXP3174, 5 mg/kg) in rats, suggesting faster 
      absorption and a 5-fold enhancement in the bioavailability of EXP3174. These 
      results suggest that EXP3174-pivoxil may serve as a more effective drug even at 
      lower clinical doses by exhibiting increased bioavailability and faster 
      therapeutic response, compared with losartan.

AB  - AIM: The study investigates the potential interaction of the herbal medicinal 
      product of Rhodiola rosea on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active 
      metabolite EXP3174 after concurrent oral administration to rabbits. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, 
      two-sequence, cross-over pharmacokinetic study on 6 healthy female New Zealand 
      rabbits, after concurrent oral administration of losartan (5 mg/kg) and the 
      herbal medicinal product of R. rosea (50 mg/kg). Quantification of losartan and 
      its main active metabolite EXP3174 was achieved using a validated HPCL/UV method. 
      Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis was performed using the EquivTest/PK 
      software. OBSERVATIONS: Administration of the herbal medicinal product of R. 
      rosea resulted in a statistically significant increase of the following 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for losartan: the maximum plasma concentration 
      (C(max)), the area under the curve (AUC) and the apparent total body clearance 
      (CL/F). An almost 2-fold increase in the AUC of losartan was observed after 
      concurrent administration of the herbal medicinal product of R. rosea. No 
      statistically significant alteration was observed in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of the active metabolite of losartan EXP3174. CONCLUSION: The data of 
      this study suggest that R. rosea significantly alters the pharmacokinetic 
      properties of losartan after concurrent oral administration to rabbits. A study 
      in humans should be conducted to assess the clinical significance of a possible 
      herb-drug interaction between the herbal medicinal products of R. rosea and drugs 
      such as losartan, which are substrates of both CYPs and P-gp.

AB  - A new spectrofluorimetric method to determine losartan potassium (LP) in rabbit 
      plasma is described. The method was based on measuring the native fluorescence of 
      LP in acidic medium. Optimum excitation and emission wavelengths were found to be 
      248 nm and 410 nm, respectively, in methanol that was diluted with a sulfurous 
      acid solution LP was extracted from rabbit plasma by methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether 
      in acidic media and then back extracted with NaOH. The calibration curves were 
      linear between 0.025 and 0.5 µg/mL with a lower limit of detection 0.004 µg/mL. 
      Precision and accuracy values of the method were calculated as lower than 4.97% 
      and ± 5.68, respectively and the recovery of LP from rabbit plasma was higher 
      than 91.1%. In addition, stability studies of LP in rabbit plasma were carried 
      out and demonstrated its good stability at - 20 °C and at room temperature. The 
      developed and validated method was successfully applied for estimating the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of LP following oral administrations of a single 10 mg 
      LP/kg to rabbits and it could be concluded that the method can be applied to 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist: pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics in rats of EXP3174, an active metabolite of losartan.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EXP3174 
      (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4- 
      yl-)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, 
      were studied in conscious rats. Elimination half-life, systemic clearance, and 
      apparent volume of distribution of EXP3174 at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. were 2.9 h, 
      1.8 ml/min/kg, and 0.25 l/kg, respectively. Inhibition of the angiotensin II 
      pressor response correlated with the log of the steady state plasma EXP3174 
      concentration in a sigmoidal fashion with an IC50 of about 200 ng/ml. When 
      corrected for plasma protein binding, the IC50 (free) for EXP3174 was 0.4 ng/ml 
      (0.9 nmol/l). This study indicates a predictable plasma concentration-effect 
      relationship of EXP3174 in rats which would be helpful in designing more rational 
      dosing schemes for pharmacodynamic studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic comparison and bioequivalence evaluation of losartan/ 
      hydrochlorothiazide tablet between Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers.
PG  - 39-54
LID - 10.5414/CP201927 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the bioequivalence between the test and reference 
      formulations of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 12.5 mg tablet and evaluate the 
      effect of ethnicity on pharmacokinetics properties of losartan, losartan 
      carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide on healthy Asian Indian and Japanese 
      volunteers. METHODS: Randomized, open-label, crossover, bioavailability studies 
      were conducted separately in healthy Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers. One 
      tablet either of test or of reference product was administered after 10 hours of 
      overnight fasting. After dosing, serial blood samples were collected for a period 
      of 48 hours for both the studies. Plasma samples were analyzed for losartan, 
      losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide by a validated liquid 
      chromatographic and mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic 
      parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, tmax, and other pharmacokinetics parameters were 
      determined from plasma concentration-time profiles for both test and reference 
      formulations of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 12.5 mg tablets. Statistical 
      evaluations were done to evaluate bioequivalence between generic test formulation 
      (EPR0001) and Japanese reference product (Preminent®). RESULTS: Losartan, 
      losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide were well tolerated by subjects 
      in all periods of each study under fasted conditions. No serious adverse events 
      were observed. The ratios of least square means for AUC0-t and Cmax and the 
      affiliated 90% confidence intervals were within acceptance range recommended by 
      PMDA. Marginal differences were observed in pharmacokinetic values of Asian 
      Indian and Japanese volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these bioavailability 
      studies indicate that the test formulation of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 
      12.5 mg (EPR0001) tablets is bioequivalent to marketed Preminent® reference 
      formulation in Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers, when administered under 
      fasting conditions. Both test and reference formulations were well tolerated as a 
      single oral dose when administered to healthy adult subjects under fasted 
      conditions. Although Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers are ethnically 
      different, results of these studies indicate that pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers are comparable to each other in terms of 
      bioavailability of losartan, losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide. 
      Similar least square means ratios were obtained in Asian Indian and Japanese 
      volunteers demonstrating that a bioequivalence study conducted on Japanese 
      volunteers seems to be substituted by Asian Indian volunteers' studies.

TI  - Losartan and E3174 pharmacokinetics in cytochrome P450 2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, and *1/*3 
      individuals.
PG  - 720-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if differences in the pharmacokinetics of losartan 
      and its pharmacologically active E3174 metabolite exist among individuals 
      expressing the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, and *1/*3 genotypes. 
      DESIGN: Single-dose pharmacokinetic study. SETTING: University general clinical 
      research center. SUBJECTS: Fifteen healthy volunteers, five from each genotype: 
      CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, and *1/*3. INTERVENTION: A single oral dose of losartan 50 
      mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma and urine samples were collected for 24 
      hours, and losartan and E3174 pharmacokinetic data were compared across the three 
      genotypes. Orthostatic blood pressure was measured over 12 hours after dosing. No 
      significant differences were observed among the three groups in losartan or E3174 
      area under the plasma concentration-time curve, losartan or E3174 elimination 
      half-life, or losartan oral clearance. A significant association between CYP2C9 
      genotype and losartan to E3174 formation clearance was observed, such that 50% of 
      the variability was accounted for by the genotype. No significant relationship 
      between that genotype and blood pressure was observed at any time. CONCLUSION: 
      Differences in the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active E3174 metabolite 
      were not observed in healthy subjects with the genotype of CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 
      compared with those expressing *1/*1. Alterations in losartan dosing in 
      CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 individuals does not appear necessary.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relations of losartan and EXP3174 in a porcine 
      animal model.
PG  - 583-90
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of losartan and EXP3174, an active metabolite of losartan, 
      were evaluated in the anesthetized pig after both a single intravenous dose (3 
      mg/kg) and during constant intravenous infusion. The pharmacodynamic activities 
      of losartan and EXP3174 were determined during constant intravenous infusion as 
      the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II-induced increase in the diastolic 
      pressure. The systemic plasma clearance of losartan was 22.1 +/- 4.4 ml/min/kg 
      (mean +/- SEM) and had an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 0.56 
      +/- 0.16 L/kg after a 3-mg/kg intravenous dose. The elimination half-life of 
      losartan was 40 +/- 6 min. Less than 2% of the intravenous losartan doses was 
      estimated to be present as unconjugated EXP3174. The plasma clearance of EXP3174 
      was approximately 50% that of losartan, 11.8 +/- 1.5 ml/min/kg, and had a smaller 
      steady-state apparent volume of distribution, 0.18 +/- 0.04 L/kg. The elimination 
      half-life for EXP3174 was slightly longer than that of losartan (52 min). The 
      time course of the pharmacodynamic effects of losartan and EXP3174 closely 
      followed their respective plasma concentrations. The apparent dissociation 
      constant of EXP3174 to the angiotensin II receptor was estimated, based on the 
      total plasma concentrations, to be approximately 5 times lower than that for 
      losartan.

TI  - Comparative pharmacokinetics of two tablet formulations of Losartan: 
      bioequivalence assessment.
PG  - 205-10
AB  - The pharmacokinetic profiles of two brands of losartan 50 mg tablets were 
      compared in 24 healthy adult volunteers after a single oral dose in a randomized 
      cross-over study. The study was conducted at the ACDIMA Center for Bioequivalence 
      & Pharmaceutical Studies, Amman, Jordan. The reference (Cozaar, MSD, The 
      Netherlands) and test (Blosart, Julphar, UAE) products were administered to 
      fasting volunteers. Blood samples were collected at specified time intervals, and 
      the plasma separated and analysed for losartan and its active metabolite 
      (losartan carboxylic acid) using a validated HPLC method with fluorescence 
      detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-t), AUC(0-alpha), C(max), T(max), 
      T(1/2), elimination rate constant, MRT, Cl/F and Vss/F were determined from 
      plasma concentration-time profiles of both formulations and found to be in good 
      agreement with reported values. Three parameters (AUC(0-t), AUC(0-alpha), and 
      C(max)) were compared statistically to evaluate the bioequivalence between the 
      two brands, using statistical modules recommended by the FDA. Analysis of 
      variance (ANOVA) did not show any significant difference between the two 
      formulations and 90% confidence intervals fell within the acceptable range 
      (80%-125%) for bioequivalence. Based on these statistical inferences it was 
      concluded that the two formulations exhibited comparable pharmacokinetic profiles 
      and that Julphar's Blosart is bioequivalent to Cozaar of MSD, The Netherlands.

TI  - Effects of myricetin, an antioxidant, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite, EXP-3174, in rats: possible role of cytochrome P450 3A4, 
      cytochrome P450 2C9 and P-glycoprotein inhibition by myricetin.
PG  - 908-14
LID - 10.1211/jpp.62.07.0012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effects of myricetin, a natural flavonoid, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, EXP-3174, were 
      investigated in rats. Losartan and myricetin interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      enzymes and P-glycoprotein, and the increase in the use of health supplements may 
      result in myricetin being taken concomitantly with losartan as a combination 
      therapy to treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of losartan and EXP-3174 were determined after oral administration of 
      losartan (9 mg/kg) to rats in the presence or absence of myricetin (0.4, 2 and 8 
      mg/kg). The effects of myricetin on P-glycoprotein as well as CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 
      activity were also evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: Myricetin inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 
      enzyme activity with a 50% inhibition concentration of 7.8 and 13.5 microm, 
      respectively. In addition, myricetin significantly enhanced the cellular 
      accumulation of rhodamine 123 in MCF-7/ADR cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein in 
      a concentration-dependent manner. The pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan were 
      significantly altered by myricetin compared with the control. The presence of 
      myricetin (2 or 8 mg/kg) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve of losartan by 31.4-61.1% and peak plasma concentration of losartan by 
      31.8-50.2%. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability of losartan in the 
      presence of myricetin increased significantly (P < 0.05, 2 mg/kg; P < 0.01, 8 
      mg/kg) compared with the control. There was no significant change in the time to 
      reach the peak plasma concentration, apparent volume of distribution at steady 
      state or terminal half-life of losartan in the presence of myricetin. 
      Furthermore, concurrent use of myricetin (8 mg/kg) significantly decreased the 
      metabolite-parent area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio by 20%, 
      implying that myricetin may inhibit the CYP-mediated metabolism of losartan to 
      its active metabolite, EXP-3174. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced bioavailability of 
      losartan may be mainly due to inhibition of the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated 
      metabolism of losartan in the small intestine or in the liver, and the 
      P-glycoprotein efflux pump in the small intestine by myricetin.

TI  - Effects of quercetin on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite 
      EXP3174 in rats.
PG  - 563-568
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2018.1478168 [doi]
AB  - 1. This study investigates the influence of quercetin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan and its metabolite EXP3174 in rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      losartan and EXP3174 of orally administered losartan (10 mg/kg) with or without 
      pretreatment with quercetin (20 mg/kg/day for 7 days) were investigated. 
      Additionally, Caco-2 cell transwell model and rat liver microsome incubation 
      experiments were also conducted to investigate its potential mechanism. 3. The 
      results showed that when the rats were pretreated with quercetin, the C(max) 
      (2.16 ± 0.40 vs. 1.33 ± 0.21 mg/L) and the AUC((0-t)) (13.89 ± 1.22 vs. 
      7.34 ± 0.75 mg·h/L) of losartan increased significantly (p < .05), and while the 
      C(max) (0.76 ± 0.09 vs. 1.14 ± 0.18 mg/L) of EXP3174 decreased significantly 
      compared to the control (p < .05). The t(1/2) of losartan was prolonged from 
      3.27 ± 0.45 h to 4.74 ± 0.51 h (p < .05). The results also indicated that 
      quercetin could increase losartan absorption rate by inhibiting the activity of 
      P-gp and decrease its metabolic stability by inhibiting the activity of CYP450 
      enzyme. 4. These results indicated that the herb-drug interaction between 
      quercetin and losartan might occur when they are co-administered in rats, 
      quercetin could increase the systemic exposure of losartan and decrease the 
      plasma concentration of EXP3174, possibly by inhibiting the activity of P-gp or 
      CYP450 enzyme.

TI  - Effect of experimental renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of losartan in rats.
PG  - 1077-83
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the pharmacokinetics 
      of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan is altered in renal failure. 
      Male Wistar rats were pretreated with uranyl nitrate or subjected to bilateral 
      ureteral ligation to produce acute renal failure (ARF). Saline-injected and 
      sham-operated rats, respectively, served as controls. Uranyl nitrate-treated rats 
      showed significantly higher serum concentrations of losartan after oral 
      administration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) 
      of losartan increased about 3-fold compared to control rats. The systemic 
      clearance of losartan significantly decreased from 410 +/- 254ml/h/kg in control 
      to 177 +/- 112ml/h/kg in uranyl nitrate-treated rats. In order to investigate the 
      mechanisms of reduced clearance of losartan associated with ARF, a hepatic 
      microsome fraction was prepared from normal and ARF rats. No significant 
      difference was found in the metabolism of losartan by hepatic microsomes prepared 
      from ARF and control rats. In addition, the metabolic activity of microsomes was 
      examined in the presence of uremic rat serum. The unbound clearance of losartan 
      and the unbound clearance associated with the formation of EXP3174 in the 
      presence of uremic serum were significantly lower than those in the presence of 
      control serum. Furthermore, the metabolism of losartan was inhibited by indoxyl 
      sulfate, a uremic toxin, in an uncompetitive manner. These results suggest that 
      ARF is associated with reduced clearance of losartan due to the inhibition of 
      hepatic metabolism by accumulated uremic toxin(s).

TI  - The effect of bucolome, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - Losartan, a selective angiotensin receptor antagonist, is mainly metabolized by 
      CYP2C9 to an active carboxylic acid, E3174, which is pharmacologically more 
      potent inhibitor than the parent compound. We evaluated the effect of bucolome, a 
      CYP2C9 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174, which were 
      measured by high performance liquid chromatography in human volunteers and rats. 
      A randomized crossover design study with two phases was done in the volunteer 
      study. In the first phase, the volunteers received losartan 25 mg alone orally 
      (LOS group), and, in the second phase, losartan 25 mg was given after repeated 
      oral administration of 300 mg bucolome for 7 days (LOS+BUC group). In the LOS 
      group, the maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration curve 
      (AUC) of losartan were significantly higher than in the LOS+BUC group. On the 
      other hand, in the LOS+BUC group, the C(max) and AUC of E3174 were significantly 
      lower than in the LOS group. In the rat study, male Wistar ST rats were used. In 
      the first phase, the rats orally received losartan 10 mg/kg alone or after 
      bucolome was given repeatedly at a dose of 20, 50, or 200 mg/kg for 7 days. In 
      the second phase for steady state, the rats were given losartan 10 mg/kg for 14 
      days (group A) or losartan 10 mg/kg and bucolome 50 mg/kg for 14 days (Group B). 
      Bucolome at doses 50 and 200 mg/kg significantly increased the AUC losartan and 
      significantly decreased the AUC of 3174. At the steady state, there were no 
      significant differences in AUC of losartan between Group A and B, but the C(max) 
      and AUC of E3174 were significantly lower in Group B than Group A.

TI  - Repaglinide-irbesartan drug interaction: effects of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on 
      repaglinide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in Chinese population.
PG  - 1021-1028
LID - 10.1007/s00228-018-2477-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: On account of the potential inhibition of OATP1B1 (organic anion 
      transporting polypeptide) by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and the 
      effects of SLCO1B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member) 
      polymorphism, the aim of current study is to assess the impact of ARBs on the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of repaglinide in Chinese healthy 
      volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes. METHODS: The in vitro study was 
      conducted on irbesartan, valsartan, olmesartan, and losartan by using HEK293 
      cells transfected with OATP1B1. Data on drug interactions between repaglinide and 
      irbesartan from 21 healthy Chinese-Han male volunteers were collected and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: IC(50) from in vitro study suggested irbesartan was the most 
      potent inhibitor of OATP1B1 transporter. Clinical data from single dose of 
      repaglinide indicated SLCO1B1 c.521 T>C polymorphism influenced the PK and PD of 
      repaglinide in healthy Chinese-Han male volunteers. In subjects with SLCO1B1 
      c.521 TT genotype, irbesartan comedication increased the exposure of repaglinide. 
      In details, the peak plasma concentration [C(max)] increased 84% (P = 0.003) and 
      the area under the curve of plasma concentration 0-8 h [AUC(0-8)] increased 34% 
      (P = 0.004), while the minimum blood glucose concentration [C(min)] decreased 
      33.8% (P = 0.005). No significant change was observed in repaglinide exposure in 
      subjects with SLCO1B1 c.521 TC genotype in presence or absence of irbesartan. 
      CONCLUSION: SLCO1B1 c.521 T>C polymorphism affects the PK of repaglinide in 
      Chinese population. Irbesartan increased repaglinide exposure in subjects with 
      SLCO1B1 c.521 TT genotype, but not SLCO1B1 c.521 TC genotype.

TI  - Effects of CYP2C9*1/*3 and *1/*13 on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite E-3174.
PG  - 683-9
LID - 10.5414/CP201467 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of CYP2C9*1/*3 and *1/*13 genotypes were evaluated on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, in Korean 
      subjects. METHODS: Losartan (50 mg) was administered in 43 Korean volunteers with 
      different CYP2C9 genotypes (CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*3 and *1/*13). Losartan and E-3174 
      levels in the plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC using fluorescence. RESULTS: 
      The CYP2C9*1/*13 subjects showed lower oral clearance (p < 0.001) and greater 
      AUC0-∞ (p < 0.01) of losartan and higher Cmax (p < 0.01) and longer half-life (p 
      < 0.001) of E-3174 than the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects, but AUC0-∞ of E-3174 was not 
      different. The CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects showed lower oral clearance (p < 0.001) of 
      losartan and higher Cmax (p < 0.01) and longer half-life (p < 0.01) of E-3174 
      than the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. However, AUC0-∞ of losartan was greater in 
      CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects than in CYP2C9*1/*1, but these results were not significant 
      (p < 0.05, but statistical power < 0.8). In addition, AUC0-∞ of E-3174 was not 
      different. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters 
      between the CYP2C9*1/*13 and CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects. CONCLUSION: These results 
      suggest that CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP2C9*1/*13 are similarly associated with decreased 
      formation of E-3174 from losartan, but the clinical effects of losartan may not 
      be reduced by CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP2C9*1/*13.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the possible interaction between selected 
      concomitant medications and orlistat at steady state in healthy subjects.
PG  - 1011-9
AB  - To investigate the influence of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics of selected 
      concomitant medications (amitriptyline, atorvastatin, cyclosporine, losartan, 
      metformin, phentermine, and sibutramine) at or within two-fold of therapeutic 
      doses, open-label, multiple-dose (for 6 or 7 days), randomized, two-period 
      (except for cyclosporine, for which a three-way crossover design was used) 
      crossover studies were performed in healthy volunteers ages 18 to 65 years, with 
      a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2. At steady state, blood samples were 
      taken for measuring plasma concentrations of interacting drugs and/or active 
      metabolites. Subjects were also evaluated for adverse events, vital signs, and 
      clinical and laboratory safety. Treatments were compared for AUC0-24, Cmax, tmax, 
      and t1/2 of selected concomitant medications (parent drugs and/or active 
      metabolites). ANOVA was performed to assess the significance of the carry-over 
      effect and provide the variance estimate for the 90% confidence intervals (CIs). 
      With the exception of cyclosporine, whose absorption was reduced by approximately 
      one-third, the results of the statistical analysis demonstrated equivalencefor 
      the two primary parameters for all drugs studied: ratios of the log-transformed 
      means for both AUC and Cmax were close to 1.00, with 90% CIs contained entirely 
      within the bioequivalence region of 0.80 to 1.25; there were no clinically 
      significant differences in t1/2 and tmax. There was a higher incidence of adverse 
      events under treatment B (selective concomitant medications and orlistat) than 
      under treatment A (selective concomitant medications alone); most of this 
      difference was due to expected gastrointestinal adverse events known to occur 
      with orlistat. Other adverse events were sporadic and unremarkable. All adverse 
      events were either mild or moderate in intensity. There were no clinically 
      relevant changes in vital signs or laboratory values. In conclusion, except for 
      cyclosporine, there was no effect of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics of 
      selective concomitant medications when these drugs were taken concomitantly with 
      orlistat.

TI  - Evaluation of the relationship between sex, polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, 
      and pharmacokinetics of angiotensin receptor blockers.
PG  - 224-9
LID - 10.1124/dmd.112.046292 [doi]
AB  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are used to treat hypertension. Most ARBs 
      are metabolized by CYP2C9. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible 
      association between sex, polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genes, and the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan, valsartan, candesartan, and telmisartan. The study 
      population comprised 246 healthy volunteers from seven single-dose clinical 
      trials: 64 from two candesartan studies, 43 from a telmisartan study, 36 from a 
      losartan study, and 103 from three valsartan studies. DNA was extracted from 
      blood samples and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 (CYP2C8*2, 
      CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4, CYP2C8*5) and CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3) genes were 
      evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Sex only affected 
      telmisartan pharmacokinetics, since women showed a higher telmisartan C(max) than 
      men (590.5 ± 75.8 ng/ml versus 282.1 ± 30.8 ng/ml; P ≤ 0.01). CYP2C9 variants 
      were associated only with losartan pharmacokinetics: the half-life of losartan 
      was higher in CYP2C9*3 allele carriers (3.1 ± 0.4 hours) than in volunteers with 
      the wild-type genotype (2.3 ± 0.1 hours) (P ≤ 0.05). CYP2C8 polymorphisms were 
      associated only with valsartan pharmacokinetics, since *2 allele carriers showed 
      faster clearance (1.07 ± 0.57 l/h·kg) than those with the wild-type genotype 
      (0.48 ± 0.72 l/h·kg; P ≤ 0.01) and carriers of the *3 allele (0.35 ± 0.49 l/h·kg; 
      P ≤ 0.001). These results suggest that genotypes for CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 are 
      relevant to the pharmacokinetics of losartan and valsartan, respectively, but not 
      the pharmacokinetics of candesartan or telmisartan.

TI  - Effect of multiple doses of losartan on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of 
      digoxin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 571-5
AB  - 1. Losartan (DuP 753, MK-954) is a novel, potent and highly selective AT1 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The effect of multiple oral doses of losartan 
      on digoxin pharmacokinetics was evaluated in healthy male subjects. 2. In a 
      double-blind and randomized fashion, subjects received 50 mg losartan or placebo 
      once daily for 15 days in each period. At least 7 days elapsed between the two 
      treatment periods. On days 4 and 11 of each period, subjects also received a 
      single 0.5 mg dose of digoxin intravenously and orally respectively. 3. Eleven of 
      13 subjects completed the study. Side effects were mild and transient (12 out of 
      13 subjects reported at least one adverse experience). During the study, no 
      laboratory abnormalities were noted. 4. Multiple oral doses of losartan (50 mg 
      daily) did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of 0.5 mg of digoxin i.v. 
      AUC(0.48h) of immunoreactive digoxin during losartan 28.8 +/- 2.9 vs 28.5 +/- 3.9 
      ng ml-1 h during placebo; not significant, and 96 h urinary excretion [% dose] 
      during losartan 54.0 +/- 7.2 vs 51.9 +/- 6.5% during placebo; not significant). 
      Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC and urinary excretion 
      were respectively, 1.03 (0.98, 1.08) and 1.09 (0.98, 1.21). 5. Multiple oral 
      doses of losartan did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of oral digoxin 
      AUC(0.48 h) during losartan 23.6 +/- 3.7 ng ml-1 h vs 22.4 +/- 2.6 ng ml-1 h 
      during placebo; not significant, Cmax 3.5 +/- 0.7 ng ml-1 with vs 3.1 +/- 0.5 ng 
      ml-1 without losartan; not significant and tmax 0.6 +/- 0.2 h with vs 0.9 +/- 0.7 
      h without losartan; not significant, and 96 h urinary excretion [% dose] during 
      losartan 51.2 +/- 6.3 vs 46.3 +/- 2.4% during placebo; not significant). 
      Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC and urinary excretion 
      were respectively, 1.06 (0.98, 1.14) and 1.12 (0.97, 1.28). 6. We conclude that 
      multiple oral doses of losartan (50 mg daily) do not alter the pharmacokinetics 
      of immunoreactive digoxin, following either intravenous or oral digoxin. 
      Furthermore, the co-administration of digoxin with losartan is well tolerated by 
      healthy male volunteers.

TI  - Comparisons of the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of fixed-dose combinations 
      of amlodipine besylate/losartan and amlodipine camsylate/losartan in healthy 
      subjects: a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence 
      crossover study.
PG  - 3021-3028
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of amlodipine and losartan has been 
      used to reduce blood pressure in patients whose hypertension is not sufficiently 
      controlled with either drug alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and tolerability of an FDC of 6.94 mg 
      amlodipine besylate (5 mg as amlodipine)/50 mg losartan potassium compared to an 
      FDC of 5 mg amlodipine camsylate/50 mg losartan potassium in healthy subjects. 
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, 
      two-sequence crossover study was conducted on 46 healthy male subjects. Blood 
      concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      Blood samples were collected up to 144 hours post dose for each period. PK 
      parameters were calculated in each treatment group using a noncompartmental 
      method. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of the 
      two treatments for the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under 
      the concentration curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point 
      (AUC(0-t)) were estimated. Tolerability assessments were performed for all 
      subjects who received the drug at least once. RESULTS: The PK profiles of the two 
      treatments were similar. For amlodipine, the geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of 
      amlodipine besylate to amlodipine camsylate for the C(max) and AUC(0-t) were 0.98 
      (0.94-1.01) and 0.97 (0.93-1.01), respectively. The corresponding values for 
      losartan were 0.91 (0.81-1.02) and 1.05 (0.98-1.12), respectively. The incidence 
      of adverse events was not significantly different between the two treatments, and 
      both were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: An FDC of 6.94 mg amlodipine besylate (5 mg 
      as amlodipine)/50 mg losartan potassium produced similar results to an FDC of 5 
      mg amlodipine camsylate/50 mg losartan potassium treatment with respect to the PK 
      parameters of amlodipine and losartan based on C(max) and AUC(0-t) values. The 
      amlodipine besylate/losartan potassium combination was well tolerated by healthy 
      male subjects.

TI  - Negligible Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Red Ginseng and Losartan, an 
      Antihypertensive Agent, in Sprague-Dawley Rats.
PG  - 1299-309
LID - 10.1080/15287394.2015.1085355 [doi]
AB  - Red ginseng (RG) is one of the top selling herbal medicines in Korea, but is not 
      recommended in hypertensive patients. In this study, the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      interaction between RG and losartan, an antihypertensive drug, was examined. RG 
      was orally administered for 2 wk to male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats at either 
      control (0), 0.5, 1, or 2 g/kg/d for 2 wk. After the last administration of RG 
      and 30 min later, all animals were treated with 10 mg/kg losartan by oral route. 
      In addition, some S-D rats were administered RG orally for 21 d at 2 g/kg 
      followed by losartan intravenously (iv) at 10 mg/kg/d. Post losartan 
      administration, plasma samples were collected at 5, 15, and 30 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 
      3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174, the active 
      metabolite of losartan, were analyzed by a high-pressure liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer system (LC-MS/MS). Oral losartan 
      administration showed dose-dependent pharmacokinetics (PK) increase with time to 
      maximum plasma, but this was not significant between different groups. There was 
      no significant change in tmax with E-3174 PK. With iv losartan, pharmacokinetics 
      showed elevation of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero 
      extrapolated to infinitity. There was not a significant change in AUCinf with 
      E-3174 PK. Therefore, RG appeared to interfere with biotransformation of 
      losartan, as RG exerted no marked effect on E-3174 PK in S-D rats. Data 
      demonstrated that oral or iv treatment with losartan in rats pretreated with RG 
      for 2 wk showed that losartan PK was affected but E-3174 PK remained unchanged 
      among different dose groups. These results suggested that RG induces negligible 
      influence on losartan and E-3174 PK in rats.

PG  - 2353-8
LID - 10.1002/jssc.200900148 [doi]
AB  - A hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method 
      (HILIC/MS/MS) for the determination of irbesartan in human plasma was developed. 
      Irbesartan and losartan (internal standard) were extracted from human plasma with 
      ethyl acetate at acidic pH. The analytes were analyzed on a Luna HILIC column 
      with the mobile phase of ACN-ammonium formate (50 mM, pH 6.5) (96:4, v/v) and 
      detected by ESI MS/MS in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The standard 
      curve was linear (r(2) = 0.9981) over the concentration range of 10-2500 ng/mL 
      and the lower LOQ was 10 ng/mL using 100 microL of plasma sample. The CV and 
      relative error for intra- and interassay at four QC levels were 2.9 to 8.1% and 
      -2.7 to 2.3%, respectively. There were less absolute and relative matrix effects 
      for irbesartan and losartan. The present method was successfully applied to the 
      pharmacokinetic study of irbesartan after oral dose of irbesartan (150 mg tablet) 
      to male healthy volunteers.

TI  - Effect of silymarin on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite 
      E-3174 in healthy Chinese volunteers.
PG  - 585-91
LID - 10.1007/s00228-009-0624-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of silymarin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan and its active metabolite E-3174 and its relationship with CYP2C9 
      genotypes. METHODS: Twelve healthy adult men of known CYP2C9 genotype (six 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 and six CYP2C9*1/*3) were recruited in a two-phase randomized 
      crossover design study. The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 were measured 
      before and after a 14-day treatment with 140 mg of silymarin three times daily. 
      RESULTS: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of losartan 
      increased significantly following a 14-day silymarin treatment in subjects with 
      the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, but not in those with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype. The AUC 
      of E-3174 decreased significantly with a silymarin pretreatment in both 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 and the CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects. The metabolic ratio of losartan (ratio 
      of AUC(0-infinity) of E-3174 to AUC(0-infinity) of losartan) decreased 
      significantly after a 14-day treatment with silymarin in individuals with the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (p < 0.05), but not in those with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype 
      (p = 0.065). CONCLUSION: Silymarin inhibits the metabolism of losartan to E-3174, 
      with the magnitude of the interaction differing in individuals with different 
      CYP2C9 genotypes.

TI  - Effect of the single CYP2C9*3 allele on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      losartan in healthy Japanese subjects.
PG  - 589-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Losartan is metabolized to the active carboxylic acid metabolite 
      EXP3174 by CYP2C9. In this study, we determined the effects of the single 
      CYP2C9*3 variant on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan. 
      METHODS: Seven healthy Japanese subjects ( CYP2C9*1/*1, n=4 and CYP2C9*1/*3, n=3) 
      were phenotyped with a single dose of losartan (25 mg). Blood and urine samples 
      were collected and assayed for losartan and EXP3174. Blood pressure and pulse 
      rate were also measured using a sphygmomanometer. RESULTS: The maximum plasma 
      concentration of EXP3174 was significantly (P<0.05) lower in the CYP2C9*1/*3 
      (n=3) group than in the CYP2C9*1/*1 (n=4) group. Diastolic blood pressure in the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 group, but not that in the CYP2C9*1/*3 group except for at 6 h and 8 
      h, was reduced from 1.5 h to 12 h compared with the baseline level. Systolic 
      blood pressure in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group, but not that in the CYP2C9*1/*3 group, 
      was reduced from 1 h to 12 h compared with the baseline level. The metabolic 
      ratio (MR) of EXP3174 concentration to the losartan concentration in plasma at 6 
      h post-dosing and the 4-h to 8-h urinary EXP3174/losartan MR were significantly 
      lower in the CYP2C9*1/*3 group than in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The plasma 6-h MR 
      and the 4-h to 8-h urinary MR were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with the 
      plasma AUC ratio (AUC(EXP3174)/AUC(losartan)), with Spearman rank correlation 
      coefficients of 0.75 and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSION: The single CYP2C9*3 
      variant reduces the metabolism of losartan and its hypotensive effect. Plasma MR, 
      as well as urine MR, may be useful for phenotyping assays of CYP2C9 activity.

TI  - Effect of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism and breviscapine on losartan 
      pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.
PG  - 616-623
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2021.1880670 [doi]
AB  - 1. Breviscapine was an active ingredient of flavonoid glycosides. Our present 
      study was conducted to evaluate the impact of breviscapine on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite E-3174, and that 
      relationship with the gene polymorphism of CYP2C9 in healthy Chinese volunteers, 
      to provide a basis for clinical rational drug use.2. The genotypes of 217 healthy 
      Chinese subjects were determined using PCR-RFLP. Twelve healthy subjects were 
      selected and were known CYP2C9 genotypes (six CYP2C9*1/*3 and six CYP2C9*1/*1) in 
      a two-phase randomised crossover design study. These subjects were given daily 
      doses of 120 mg (40 mg, three times a day) of breviscapine or a placebo for 
      14 days, followed by 50 mg losartan on day 15.3. Compared with individuals 
      carrying the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype showed an increase in 
      the AUC((0-36)) (833.6 ± 379.8 ng h ml(-1) vs. 526.1 ± 140.1 ng h ml(-1), 
      p < 0.05) and a decrease in the MR (the metabolic ratio of losartan, 
      AUC(E-3174)/AUC(losartan)) (2.67 ± 1.40 vs. 4.56 ± 0.83, p < 0.05) of losartan 
      during the placebo treatment phase. Individuals with genotype CYP2C9*1/*3 showed 
      a significant increase in AUC((0-36)) (2335 ± 851.8 ng h ml(-1) vs. 
      1927 ± 949.5 ng h ml(-1), p < 0.05) and AUC((0-∞)) (2363 ± 875.6 ng h ml(-1) vs. 
      1966 ± 966.1 ng h ml(-1), p < 0.05) of E-3174 after breviscapine treatment 
      compared to the placebo group.4. In healthy subjects, breviscapine had no 
      significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of losartan. The activity of CYP2C9 
      enzyme to losartan metabolism was more significant in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3 
      than those with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype.

TI  - Effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa and Zingiber officinale on the antihypertensive 
      activity and pharmacokinetic of losartan in hypertensive rats.
PG  - 847-857
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2020.1729446 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to determine the effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa and 
      Zingiber officinale on antihypertensive activity and pharmacokinetic of losartan 
      in hypertensive rats.Hypertension was induced in rats by oral administration of 
      L-NAME (40 mg/kg per day). Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of losartan were 
      evaluated without and with herbal treatment in hypertensive rats.Treatment of 
      hypertensive rats with investigated herbs substantially reduced systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of rats. Treatment of rats 
      (n = 5) with L-NAME plus H. sabdariffa plus losartan and L-NAME plus Z. 
      officinale plus losartan reduced SBP by 16.20% and 14.88% and DBP by 14.82% and 
      17.52% respectively after 12 h, as compared to L-NAME alone treated rats. In a 
      pharmacokinetic study, the C(max) and AUC(0-t) of losartan in L-NAME plus H. 
      sabdariffa plus losartan and L-NAME plus Z. officinale plus losartan treated rats 
      was increased by 0.7, 1.99 and 1.51, 3.00 fold respectively in comparison to the 
      C(max) and AUC(0-t) obtained for L-NAME plus losartan treated group. In 
      conclusion, both the investigated herbs significantly increased the 
      antihypertensive effect and plasma concentration of losartan in L-NAME induced 
      hypertensive rats. The current study predicted that the herb-drug interaction 
      between H. sabdariffa-losartan and Z. officinale-losartan could occur; hence 
      these results in rats may warrant further studies in humans, either in humans or 
      in in vitro human liver microsomes.

TI  - HPLC determination of irbesartan in human plasma: its application to 
      pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 568-72
LID - 10.1002/bmc.1154 [doi]
AB  - A simple and rapid HPLC method using fluorescence detection was developed for 
      determination of irbesartan in human plasma. Sample preparation was accomplished 
      through a simple deproteinization procedure with 0.4 mL of acetonitrile 
      containing 800 ng/mL of losartan (internal standard), and to a 0.1 mL plasma 
      sample. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Zorbax Xclipse XDB C18 
      column (150 x 4.6 mm, i.d., 5 microm) at 40 degrees C. An isocratic mobile phase, 
      acetonitrile:0.1% formic acid (37:63, v/v), was run at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL/min, 
      and the column eluent was monitored using a fluorescence detector set at 
      excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 and 370 nm, respectively. The 
      retention times of irbesartan and losartan were 4.4 and 5.9 min, respectively. 
      This assay was linear over a concentration range of 10-5000 ng/mL with a lower 
      limit of quantification of 10 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation for this assay 
      precision was less than 8.48%, and the accuracy exceeded 94.4%. The mean relative 
      recoveries of irbesartan and losartan were 98.4 and 99.1%, respectively. This 
      method was successfully applied for pharmacokinetic study after oral 
      administration of irbesartan (300 mg) to 23 Korean healthy male volunteers.

TI  - Application of back-propagation artificial neural network and curve estimation in 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan in rabbit.
PG  - 22352-8
AB  - In order to develop pharmacokinetic model, a well-known multilayer feed-forward 
      algorithm back-propagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANN) was applied to the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan in rabbit. The plasma concentrations of losartan in 
      twelve rabbits, which were divided into two groups and given losartan 2 mg/kg by 
      intravenous (Iv) and intragastrical (Ig) administration, were determined by 
      LC-MS. The BP-ANN model included one input layer, hidden layers, and one output 
      layer was constructed and compared with curve estimation based on the 
      time-concentration data of losartan. The results showed the BP-ANN model had high 
      goodness of fit index and good coherence (R > 0.99) between forecasted 
      concentration and measured concentration both in Iv and Ig administration. The 
      residuals of each concentrations generated by BP-ANN model were all smaller than 
      Curve estimation. The pharmacokinetic result showed there was no significant 
      difference between measured and simulated pharmacokinetic parameters including 
      AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), MRT(0-t), MRT(0-∞), T1/2 V and Cmax (P > 0.05). In 
      conclusion, the BP-ANN model has remarkably accurate predictions ability, which 
      better than Curve estimation, and can be used as a utility tool in 
      pharmacokinetic experiment.

TI  - Effects of Ginkgo leaf tablets on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats and its mechanism.

AB  - CONTEXT: Ginkgo leaf tablets (GLTs) and losartan are often simultaneously used 
      for the treatment of hypertension in Chinese clinics. However, the herb-drug 
      interaction between GLT and losartan is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigates the effects of GLT on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats and its potential mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The pharmacokinetic profiles of losartan and EXP3174 of orally administered 
      losartan (10 mg/kg) with or without GLT pretreatment (80 mg/kg/day for 10 days) 
      in Sprague-Dawley rats were determined. In vitro, the effects of GLT on the 
      metabolic stability of losartan were investigated with rat liver microsomes. 
      RESULTS: The C(max) (1.22 ± 0.25 vs 1.85 ± 0.37 μg/mL) and the AUC((0-)(t)()) 
      (6.99 ± 1.05 vs 11.94 ± 1.79 mg·h/L) of losartan increased significantly 
      (p < 0.05) with GLT pretreatment, while the C(max) (1.05 ± 0.19 vs 
      0.72 ± 0.12 μg/mL) of EXP3174 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the 
      control. The t(1/2) of losartan was prolonged significantly from 3.94 ± 0.62 to 
      4.75 ± 0.52 h (p < 0.05). The metabolic stability of losartan was increased from 
      37.4 min to 59.6 min with GLT pretreatment. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results indicate that GLT might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and 
      decrease the concentration of EXP3174 through inhibiting the metabolism of 
      losartan.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether Xuesaitong, a multiherbal 
      formulation for coronary heart disease, alters the pharmacokinetics of losartan. 
      Adult male Sprague Dawley rats randomly received losartan (10 mg/kg) or losartan 
      plus Xuesaitong (10 mg/kg) through an oral gavage (n = 6). Multiple blood samples 
      were obtained for up to 36 h to determine the concentrations of losartan and its 
      active metabolite, EXP3174, through ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Pharmacokinetics were estimated using a 
      noncompartmental model. The half-life (t (1/2)) of losartan was decreased by 
      Xuesaitong (4.26 ± 1.51 vs. 6.35 ± 2.10 h; P < 0.05). The apparent volume of 
      distribution (V (d)) of losartan was also decreased by the combination of 
      losartan and Xuesaitong (4.41 ± 1.61 vs. 7.20 ± 2.41 mL; P < 0.05). The time to 
      maximum concentration (T (max)) of losartan was increased by Xuesaitong 
      (1.06 ± 1.04 vs. 0.13 ± 0.05 h; P < 0.05). Xuesaitong also decreased the t (1/2) 
      of EXP3174 (8.22 ± 1.41 vs. 6.29 ± 1.38 h; P < 0.05). These results suggest that 
      there is a complex interaction between losartan and Xuesaitong. In addition to 
      enhanced elimination of losartan and EXP3174, Xuesaitong may also decrease the 
      absorption rate and V (d) of losartan.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite E-3174 in relation to the CYP2C9 
      genotype.
PG  - 89-98
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Losartan is metabolized by polymorphic CYP2C9 to E-3174. Our 
      aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 in relation to 
      the CYP2C9 genotype. METHODS: A 50-mg oral dose of losartan was given to 22 
      Swedish volunteers with different CYP2C9 genotypes. Losartan and E-3174 were 
      analyzed by HPLC in plasma and urine samples collected up to 24 hours after drug 
      intake. Furthermore, losartan and E-3174 were analyzed in 8-hour urine samples 
      collected from 17 Spanish subjects after a single oral dose of 25 mg losartan. 
      RESULTS: The maximum plasma concentration of E-3174 was significantly (P <.05) 
      lower in the CYP2C9*1/*3 (n = 5) and CYP2C9*2/*3 (n = 4) groups compared with the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 (n = 6) and CYP2C9*1/*2 (n = 3) groups and extremely low in 1 subject 
      with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. The ratio of the total losartan area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) to the total E-3174 AUC 
      (AUC(losartan)/AUC(E-3174)) was higher in the subject with the CYP2C9*3/*3 
      genotype (30-fold) and also in the CYP2C9*1/*3 and *2/*3 groups (approximately 2- 
      and 3-fold, respectively) compared with the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The plasma ratios 
      correlated significantly with the 0- to 8-hour urinary losartan/E-3174 ratios. 
      Among the total of 39 subjects, the urinary ratio was significantly higher in 
      subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*3 (n = 10) and *2/*3 (n = 4) genotypes than in those 
      with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (n = 11; P <.01) and approximately 40-fold higher 
      in subjects with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype (n = 3). CONCLUSION: The CYP2C9*3 
      allele was shown to be associated with decreased formation of E-3174 from 
      losartan. The significant differences between genotypes in plasma and urine 
      losartan/E-3174 ratios and the good correlation between the plasma and urine 
      ratios suggest that the losartan/E-3174 ratio in 0- to 8-hour urine specimens may 
      serve as a phenotyping assay for CYP2C9 activity. Further studies in larger 
      populations will be required to establish this.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist losartan potassium (DuP 753/MK 954) in the dog.
PG  - 1199-205
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and plasma concentration-effect relationship for the 
      nonpeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist losartan potassium 
      (losartan) have been determined with conscious and anesthetized dogs. The p.o. 
      bioavailability of single doses of 5 to 20 mg/kg was low, 23 to 33%, and 
      independent of the dose. Absorption was rapid, with peak plasma levels observed 
      within 1 hr, and the Cmax and area under the concentration vs. time curve to 
      infinity were proportional to the dose, P < .05. The elimination half-life, 108 
      to 153 min, was longer than that observed after a single i.v. dose, 41 min, and 
      may reflect both continuous absorption and enterohepatic recirculation because 
      the major route of excretion was via the bile. Single i.v. doses were eliminated 
      rapidly, with a systemic plasma clearance of 22.2 ml/min/kg. When corrected for 
      the blood:plasma distribution ratio, 0.66 to 0.72, the systemic clearance 
      approximates hepatic blood flow, suggesting that clearance is primarily via 
      hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. Losartan was not distributed 
      extensively to tissues; apparent volume of distribution at steady-state of 0.30 
      liters/kg and was highly but not extensively bound to plasma proteins; 2.7 to 
      2.9% unbound (free). The plasma concentration vs. blockade of exogenous Ang 
      II-induced vasopressor response was also determined after a single 3-mg/kg i.v. 
      dose of losartan with a sigmoidal Emax model. Blockade of the pressor response 
      was rapid, 89% at 5 min, and declined to 11% at 240 min postdose. The 
      relationship between concentration and effect was highly significant (r = 0.922, 
      P < .01), with an IC50 (total) of 96 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active 
      metabolite E3174 in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 369-73
AB  - Grapefruit juice (GJ), a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, may affect the 
      pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized through CYP 3A4. Losartan, an angiotensin 
      II antagonist, is converted into its main active metabolite E3174 by CYP 3A4 and 
      CYP 2C9. The effect of GJ on losartan pharmacokinetics was assessed in a 
      randomized crossover trial. Losartan was given to 9 volunteers with and without 
      GJ. Concentrations of losartan and its E3174 metabolite were determined in serum 
      by a high-performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC). Significant 
      differences were observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan 
      and its metabolite E3174 after losartan administration with and without 
      co-administered GJ. The lag time (time to drug appearance in serum) of losartan 
      increased significantly with co-administered GJ. The mean residence time (MRT) 
      and half-life (t(1/2)) of the E3174 metabolite were significantly longer and the 
      area under the concentration--time curve (AUC) of the E3174 metabolite was 
      significantly smaller after concomitant GJ administration. The ratio 
      AUC(losartan)/AUC(E3174) was significantly increased after concurrent grapefruit 
      juice intake. The increased lag time of losartan and the increased MRT and t1/2 
      and decreased AUC of E3174 were considered indicative of simultaneous CYP 3A4 
      inhibition and P-glycoprotein activation. The significantly increased 
      AUC(losartan)/AUC(E3174) ratio, however, indicates reduced losartan conversion to 
      E3174 by CYP 3A4 metabolism as a result of co-administered GJ.

TI  - The role of CYP2C9 genotype in the metabolism of diclofenac in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 729-35
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C9 (CYP2C9) catalyses the 
      metabolism of many drugs including S-warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenytoin, 
      tolbutamide, losartan and most of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
      Diclofenac is metabolised to 4'-hydroxy (OH), the major diclofenac metabolite, 
      3'-OH and 3'-OH-4'-methoxy metabolites by CYP2C9. The aim of the present study 
      was to clarify the impact of the CYP2C9 polymorphism on the metabolism of 
      diclofenac both in vivo and in vitro. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 
      healthy volunteers with different CYP2C9 genotypes [i.e. CYP2C9*1/ *1 (n = 6), 
      *1/*2 (n = 3), *1,/*3 (n = 5), *2/*3 (n = 4), *21*2 (n = 1), *31*3 (n = 1)] 
      received a single 50-mg oral dose of diclofenac. Plasma pharmacokinetics [peak 
      plasma concentration (Cmax), half-life (t 1/2) and area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUCtotal)] and urinary recovery of diclofenac and its 
      metabolites were compared between the genotypes. Diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation was 
      also analysed in vitro in 16 different samples of genotyped [i.e. CYP2C9*1/*1 (n 
      = 7), *1/*2 (n=2), *1/*3 (n = 2), *2/*3 (n = 2), *2/*2 (n = 2), *31/*3 (n = 1)] 
      human liver microsomes. RESULTS: Within each genotype group, a high variability 
      was observed in kinetic parameters for diclofenac and 4'-OH-diclofenac (6- and 
      20-fold, respectively). No significant differences were found between the 
      different genotypes either in vivo or in human liver microsomes. No correlation 
      was found between the plasma AUC ratio of diclofenac/4'-OH-diclofenac and that of 
      losartan/ E-3174, previously determined in the same subjects. CONCLUSION: No 
      relationship was found between the CYP2C9 genotype and the 4'-hydroxylation of 
      diclofenac either in vivo or in vitro. This, together with the lack of 
      correlation between losartan oxidation and diclofenac hydroxylation in vivo 
      raises the question about the usefulness of diclofenac as a CYP2C9 probe.

TI  - Effects of berberine on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite 
      EXP3174 in rats and its mechanism.
PG  - 2886-2894
AB  - CONTEXT: Losartan and berberine (BBR) are often simultaneously used for the 
      treatment of senile diabetic nephropathy in clinics. However, the potential 
      herb-drug interaction between losartan and BBR is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigates the influence of BBR on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      EXP3174, and investigates the effects of BBR on the metabolic stability of 
      losartan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacokinetic profiles losartan and 
      EXP3174 of orally administered losartan (10 mg/kg) with and without pretreatment 
      with BBR (20 mg/kg) within 24 h were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats. The 
      inhibitory effects of BBR on the metabolic stability of losartan were 
      investigated using rat liver microsomes. RESULTS: The C(max) (1.26 ± 0.37 versus 
      1.96 ± 0.45 mg/L) and the AUC((0-)(t)()) (8.25 ± 0.89 versus 12.70 ± 1.42 mg h/L) 
      of losartan were significantly (p < 0.05) increased by BBR compared to the 
      control, while the C(max) (0.97 ± 0.15 versus 0.77 ± 0.06 mg/L) of EXP3174 was 
      significantly decreased compared to the control (p < 0.05). The T(max) of 
      losartan was prolonged from 0.41 ± 0.12 to 0.52 ± 0.18 h, but the difference was 
      not significant. However, the T(max) of EXP3174 was decreased significantly 
      (p < 0.05) from 8.14 ± 0.36 to 3.33 ± 0.28 h. The metabolic stability of losartan 
      was increased from 37.4 to 59.6 min. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We infer that BBR 
      might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and decrease the 
      concentration of EXP3174 through inhibiting the activity of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination and Pharmacokinetics of Metolazone, Losartan and 
      Losartan Carboxylic Acid in Rat Plasma by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
PG  - 1520-7
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmv047 [doi]
AB  - For the first time, we developed and validated a highly sensitive, selective and 
      rapid HPLC-ESI-MS-MS method for simultaneous quantification of metolazone (MET), 
      losartan (LOS) and its metabolite losartan carboxylic acid (LCA) in rat plasma. 
      After solid-phase extraction, the analytes and internal standard (irbesartan) 
      were extracted from 100 µL plasma sample on an Agilent Poroshell 120, EC-C18 (50 
      × 4.6 mm, i.d., 2.7 µm) column using 5 µL injection volume with a total run time 
      of 3 min. Acidified methanol/water mixture was used as a mobile phase. The parent 
      → product ion transitions for MET (m/z 366.0 → 258.9), LOS (m/z 423.2 → 207.0), 
      LCA (m/z 437.0 → 235.1) and IS (m/z 429.2 → 207.0) were monitored on a triple 
      quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in the multiple reaction monitoring and 
      positive ion mode. The method was found to be linear in the range of 0.05-250 for 
      MET, 2-3,000 for LOS and 4-3,500 ng/mL for LCA. The method was validated with 
      respect to selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery and stability 
      according to accepted regulatory guidelines. The described method was 
      successfully applied to preclinical pharmacokinetic studies of analytes after an 
      oral administration of mixture of MET (1 mg/kg) and LOS (10 mg/kg) in rats.

AB  - A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      method for simultaneous determination of febuxostat and its three active 
      metabolites in human plasma was developed using a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (50 mm × 
      4.6 mm, 5 μm) and an optimized gradient mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, 
      water and formic acid. Plasma samples were spiked with the internal standard 
      losartan and then pre-treated using one-step protein precipitation with methanol. 
      Mass spectrometric detection was performed by selective reaction monitoring mode 
      via electrospray ionization source operating in positive ionization mode. The 
      method exhibited good linearity over the concentration range of 10-20,000 ng/mL 
      for febuxostat, 1.0-270 ng/mL for 67M-1 and 67M-2, and 0.8-250 ng/mL for 67 M-4, 
      respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 14.7% and the 
      accuracy ranged from -4.3% to 5.1%. The method was successfully applied to a 
      clinical pharmacokinetic study of febuxostat in humans after oral administration 
      of a single dose of febuxostat at 40, 80 and 120 mg.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a losartan potassium released from a transdermal therapeutic 
      system for the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 679-82
AB  - Monolithic transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) were developed for sustained 
      antihypertensive effect of losartan potassium using the polymers Eudragit E 100 
      and polyvinyl pyrrolidone VA 64. The developed formulations (polymeric films) 
      were evaluated for physical characteristics, ex vivo (histopathology) and in vivo 
      (pharmacokinetic studies). Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as C(max), t(max), 
      and AUC were estimated. The transdermal formulation in the present study was 
      found to enhance the relative bioavailability of losartan potassium by 2.2 times 
      with reference to an oral delivery. The increased bioavailability might be due to 
      elimination of hepatic first pass metabolism. Thus, the transdermal formulation 
      F3E with polymeric composition of Eudragit E 100 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone VA 64 
      (5:3) was found to provide prolonged steady state concentrations of losartan 
      potassium with minimal fluctuations and improved bioavailability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate felodipine as a potential perpetrator of pharmacokinetic 
      drug-drug interactions (PK-DDIs) involving cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp). METHODS: Felodipine extended-release 10 mg was 
      administered daily to six healthy subjects for 7 days (days 1-7). Subjects were 
      administered a modified Inje cocktail comprising the selective probe substrates 
      caffeine 100 mg (CYP1A2), losartan 25 mg (CYP2C9), omeprazole 20 mg (CYP2C19), 
      dextromethorphan 30 mg (CYP2D6), midazolam 2 mg (CYP3A) and digoxin 250 μg (P-gp) 
      on day 0 (prior to felodipine exposure) and day 7 (after felodipine exposure). 
      Plasma samples were collected over 24 h and drug concentrations measured by 
      UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The geometric means of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve ratios (probe AUC after felodipine exposure/probe AUC 
      prior to felodipine exposure) and 95% confidence intervals for each probe were: 
      caffeine 0.91 (0.64-1.30), losartan 1.05 (0.95-1.15), omeprazole 1.17 
      (0.78-1.76), dextromethorphan 1.46 (1.00-2.12), midazolam 1.23 (0.99-1.52) and 
      digoxin 1.01 (0.89-1.15). CONCLUSION: Felodipine may be a weak in vivo inhibitor 
      of CYP3A and CYP2D6 but is unlikely to act as a significant perpetrator of 
      PK-DDIs.

TI  - Phase 1 and Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Metformin, Losartan, 
      and Linagliptin Coadministered With DW1029M in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 408-419
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.320 [doi]
AB  - We investigated botanical drug-pharmaceutical drug interactions between DW1029M 
      (a botanical extract of Morus alba linne root bark and Puerariae radix) and 
      metformin, losartan, and linagliptin in the steady state. Three studies were 
      conducted as randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-treatment, multiple-dose, 2-way 
      crossover designs. Eligible subjects received metformin (500 mg twice daily), 
      losartan (50 mg once daily), or linagliptin (5 mg once daily) with DW1029M 
      (300 mg × 2T twice daily) every 12 hours on days 1 through 6 and a single dose on 
      the morning of day 7. Coadministration of DW1029M with metformin, losartan, or 
      linagliptin had no clinically relevant effects based on the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC(τ) ) geometric least-squares mean ratio (GMR) - 
      AUC(τ) GMR, 89.7; 90% confidence interval (CI), 81.0-99.4 for metformin; AUC(τ) 
      GMR, 96.2; 90%CI, 86.3-107.1 for losartan; and AUC(τ) GMR, 89.7; 90%CI, 83.2-96.6 
      for linagliptin. In addition, coadministration of DW1029M did not have any 
      clinically meaningful effect on the maximum plasma concentration (C(max,ss) ) - 
      C(max,ss) GMR, 87.3; 90%CI, 76.2-100.0 for metformin; C(max,ss) GMR, 90.5; 90%CI, 
      78.3-104.6 for losartan; and C(max,ss) GMR, 81.4; 90%CI, 69.5-95.3 for 
      linagliptin. Coadministration of DW1029M with metformin, losartan, or linagliptin 
      was well tolerated.

TI  - Effects of licochalcon A on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active 
      metabolite, EXP-3174, in rats.
PG  - 882-8
AB  - Losartan and licochalcon A interact with cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and the increase in the use of health supplements may 
      result in licochalcon A being taken concomitantly with losartan to treat or 
      prevent cardiovascular diseases as a combination therapy. The effect of 
      licochalcon A, a natural flavonoid, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite, EXP-3174, was investigated in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      of losartan and EXP-3174 were determined after oral administration of losartan (9 
      mg/kg) to rats in the presence or absence of licochalcon A (0.5, 2.5 and 10 
      mg/kg). The effect of licochalcon A on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as well as CYP3A4 
      and 2C9 activities was also evaluated. Licochalcon A inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 
      enzyme activities with 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) of 2.0 and 0.1 
      microM, respectively. In addition, licochalcon A significantly enhanced the 
      cellular accumulation of rhodamine-123 in a concentration-dependent manner in 
      MCF-7/ADR cells overexpressing P-gp. The pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan 
      were significantly altered by licochalcon A. Licochalcon A (2.5 mg/kg or 10 
      mg/kg) increased AUC0-infinity of losartan by 33.4-63.2% and Cmax of losartan by 
      34.0-62.8%. The total body clearance (CL/F) was significantly decreased (2.5 
      mg/kg, p < 0.05; 10 mg/kg, p < 0.01) by licochalcon A. Consequently, the absolute 
      bioavailability of losartan in the presence of licochalcon A increased 
      significantly (2.5 mg/kg, p < 0.05; 10 mg/kg, p < 0.01) compared to that in the 
      control group. The relative bioavailability (R.B.) of losartan was 1.15- to 
      1.63-fold greater than that of the control group. However, there was no 
      significant change in Tmax and t1/2 of losartan in the presence of licochalcon A. 
      Licochalcon A (10 mg/kg) increased the AUC0-infinity of EXP-3174 but this was not 
      significant. Furthermore, concurrent use of licochalcon A (10 mg/kg) 
      significantly decreased the metabolite-parent AUC ratio (M.R.) by 20%, suggesting 
      that licochalcon A inhibited the CYP-mediated metabolism of losartan to its 
      active metabolite, EXP-3174. In conclusion, the enhanced oral bioavailability of 
      losartan in the presence of licochalcon A may mainly result from decreased 
      P-gp-mediated efflux transporter in the small intestine and from the inhibition 
      of CYP 3A- and CYP2C9-mediated metabolism in the small intestine and liver and/or 
      from the reduction of total body clearance of losartan by licochalcon A.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, safety, and antihypertensive efficacy of losartan in 
      combination with hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with renal 
      impairment.
PG  - 591-603
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 7 days of treatment with losartan 50 
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were evaluated in 14 patients with normal renal 
      function and in 12 patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The efficacy 
      of losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg titrated to losartan 100 
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg was examined in 32 hypertensive patients with mild 
      to moderate renal impairment who were treated for 12 weeks. Safety was assessed 
      in both studies by the incidence of adverse experiences. After 7 days of 
      treatment, the AUC for losartan, E-3174, and hydrochlorothiazide was slightly 
      higher in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, but the reduction in 
      blood pressure (BP) after 7 days was not different between the two groups. The 
      final (week 12) mean reductions in trough sitting diastolic and systolic BP were 
      15.0 +/- 7.1 mmHg (p < 0.01) and 20.8 +/- 16.7 mmHg (p < 0.01), respectively. 
      There were no observed increases in drug-related adverse experiences in either 
      study. Overall, the combination of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide was effective in 
      lowering blood pressure and was well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate 
      renal impairment.

TI  - Fluconazole but not itraconazole decreases the metabolism of losartan to E-3174.
PG  - 445-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Losartan is metabolised to its active metabolite E-3174 by CYP2C9 and 
      CYP3A4 in vitro. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, whereas fluconazole 
      affects CYP2C9 more than CYP3A4. We wanted to study the possible interaction of 
      these antimycotics with losartan in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A randomised, 
      double-blind, three-phase crossover study design was used. Eleven healthy 
      volunteers ingested orally, once a day for 4 days, either itraconazole 200 mg, 
      fluconazole (400 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on days 2-4) or placebo (control). On day 
      4, a single 50-mg oral dose of losartan was ingested. Plasma concentrations of 
      losartan, E-3174, itraconazole, hydroxy-itraconazole and fluconazole were 
      determined over 24 h. The blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded over 
      24 h. RESULTS: The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve 
      [AUC(0-infinity)] of E-3174 were significantly decreased by fluconazole to 30% 
      and to 47% of their control values, respectively, and the t1/2 was increased to 
      167%. Fluconazole caused only a nonsignificant increase (23-41%) in the AUC and 
      t1/2 of the unchanged losartan. Itraconazole had no significant effect on the 
      pharmacokinetic variables of losartan or E-3174. The ratio 
      AUC(0-infinity)(E-3174)/AUC(0-infinity)losartan was 60% smaller during the 
      fluconazole than during the placebo and itraconazole phases. No clinically 
      significant changes in the effects of losartan on blood pressure and heart rate 
      were observed between fluconazole, itraconazole and placebo phases. CONCLUSION: 
      Fluconazole but not itraconazole interacts with losartan by inhibiting its 
      metabolism to the active metabolite E-3174. This implicates that, in man, CYP2C9 
      is a major enzyme for the formation of E-3174 from losartan. The clinical 
      significance of the fluconazole losartan interaction is unclear, but the 
      possibility of a decreased therapeutic effect of losartan should be kept in mind.

TI  - Determination and validation of LJ-2698, a potent human A(3) adenosine receptor 
      antagonist, in rat plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and 
      its application in pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 952-961

AB  - LJ-2698, a highly potent human A(3) adenosine receptor antagonist with nucleoside 
      structure, was designed to have a minimal species dependence. For further 
      pre-clinical studies, analytical method for the detection of LJ-2698 in rat 
      plasma was developed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass. Plasma samples were 
      processed by protein precipitation method with acetonitrile, using losartan as 
      the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was carried out using a 
      Kinetex C18 column (100 × 4.6 mm; 100 Å; 2.6 μ) with acetonitrile/water with 0.2% 
      (v/v) formic acid (65:35, v/v) in the isocratic mode at a flow rate of 
      0.4 mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode was 
      performed with positive electrospray ionization. The mass transitions of LJ-2698 
      and IS were m/z 412.3 → 294.1 and m/z 423.1 → 207.2, respectively. The 
      calibration curves were linear in the range 5.00-5000 ng/mL (r (2) ≥ 0.998). The 
      lower limit of quantification was established as 5.00 ng/mL. Within- and 
      between-run precisions were <7.01%, as relative standard deviation; and 
      accuracies were in the range 3.37-3.64%, as relative error. The validated method 
      was successfully applied to its pharmacokinetic evaluation after intravenous and 
      oral administration in rats, and the dose-dependent pharmacokinetic behavior of 
      LJ-2698 was elucidated for the first time.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination and Pharmacokinetic Study of Losartan, Losartan 
      Carboxylic Acid, Ramipril, Ramiprilat, and Hydrochlorothiazide in Rat Plasma by a 
      Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method.
PG  - 107-24

AB  - The monitoring of the plasmatic concentrations of cardiovascular drugs is crucial 
      for understanding their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A simple, 
      sensitive, specific, and high-throughput liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous 
      estimation and pharmacokinetic study of losartan (LOS), losartan carboxylic acid 
      (LCA), ramipril (RAM), ramiprilate (RPT), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ) in rat 
      plasma using irbesartan (IBS) and metolazone (MET) as internal standards (ISs). 
      After solid phase extraction (SPE), analytes and ISs were separated on an Agilent 
      Poroshell 120, EC-C18 (50 mm × 4.6 mm, i.d., 2.7 μm) column with a mobile phase 
      consisting of methanol/water (85:15, v/v) containing 5 mmol/L ammonium formate 
      and 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The precursor → product ion 
      transitions for the analytes and ISs were monitored on a triple quadrupole mass 
      spectrometer, operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode and 
      switching the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode during chromatography from 
      positive (to detect LOS, LCA, RAM, RPT, and IBS) to negative (to detect HCZ and 
      MET). The method was validated as per the FDA guidelines and it exhibited 
      sufficient specificity, accuracy, and precision. The method was found to be 
      linear in the range of 3-3000 ng/mL for LOS and LCA, 0.1-200 ng/mL for RAM and 
      RPT, and 1-1500 ng/mL for HCZ. The described method was successfully applied to 
      the preclinical pharmacokinetic study of analytes after oral administration of a 
      mixture of LOS (10 mg/kg), RAM (1 mg/kg), and HCZ (2.5 mg/kg) in rats.

TI  - Effects of salvianolic acid B and tanshinone IIA on the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan in rats by regulating the activities and expression of CYP3A4 and 
      CYP2C9.

AB  - Losartan (LST) is a common chemical drug used to treat high blood pressure and 
      reduce the risk of stroke in certain people with heart disease. Danshen, prepared 
      from the dried root and rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been widely 
      used for prevention and treatment of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
      diseases. There are more than 35 formulations containing Danshen indexed in the 
      2010 Chinese Pharmacopoeia, which are often combined with LST to treat 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the clinic. The effects of the two 
      major components of Danshen, salvianolic acid B (SA-B) and tanshinone IIA (Tan 
      IIA), on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite, EXP3174, in rats 
      were investigated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: LST, 
      LST+SA-B and LST+Tan IIA, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated 
      after oral administration of LST, LST+SA-B and LST+Tan IIA. It was found that 
      there are significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the 
      three groups: Cmax, t1/2, AUC, AUMC in the LST+SA-B group was smaller than those 
      in group LST, while larger in group LST+Tan IIA. Further, the effects of SA-B and 
      Tan IIA on the metabolism of losartan was also investigated using rat liver 
      microsomes in vitro. The results indicated that SA-B can induce the metabolism of 
      LST, while Tan IIA can inhibit the metabolism of LST in rat liver microsomes in 
      vitro by regulating activities of CYP450 enzymes. In addition, the effect of SA-B 
      and Tan IIA on CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 expression was studied in Chang liver cells by 
      western-blotting and Real-time PCR. It was concluded that the two components of 
      Danshen, SA-B and Tan IIA have different influences on the metabolism of LST: 
      SA-B can obviously speed up the metabolism of LST by inducing CYP3A4/CYP2C9 
      activities and expression, however, Tan IIA can slow down the metabolism of LST 
      by inhibiting CYP3A4/CYP2C9 activities.

TI  - Evaluation of potential drug interactions with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate: a 
      single-center, open-label, one sequence crossover study in healthy adults.
PG  - 1808-1816
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfaa222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) is an oral 
      potassium binder for the treatment of hyperkalemia in adults. SZC acts in the 
      gastrointestinal tract and additionally binds hydrogen ions in acidic 
      environments like the stomach, potentially transiently increasing gastric pH and 
      leading to drug interactions with pH-sensitive drugs. This study assessed 
      potential pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between SZC and nine pH-sensitive 
      drugs. METHODS: In this single-dose, open-label, single-sequence cross-over study 
      in healthy adults, amlodipine, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, dabigatran, furosemide, 
      glipizide, levothyroxine, losartan or warfarin were each administered alone and, 
      following a washout interval, with SZC 10 g. Maximum plasma concentration (C 
      (max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the last time 
      point (AUC(0-) (t) ) and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC(inf)) were evaluated. 
      No interaction was concluded if the 90% confidence interval for the geometric 
      mean ratio (SZC coadministration versus alone) of the PK parameters was within 
      80-125%. RESULTS: During SZC coadministration, all PK parameters for amlodipine, 
      glipizide, levothyroxine and losartan showed no interaction, while reductions in 
      clopidogrel and dabigatran C (max), AUC(0-) (t) and AUC(inf) (basic drugs) were 
      <50% and increases in atorvastatin, furosemide and warfarin C (max) (acidic 
      drugs) exceeded the no-interaction range by ˂2-fold. CONCLUSIONS: SZC 
      coadministration was associated with small changes in plasma concentration and 
      exposure of five of the nine drugs evaluated in this study. These PK drug 
      interactions are consistent with transient increases in gastric pH with SZC and 
      are unlikely to be clinically meaningful.

PG  - 53-63
AB  - DuP 532, 2-propyl-4-pentafluoroethyl-1-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biph eny 
      l-4-]methyl) imidazole-5-carboxylic acid, is an orally active, non-peptide 
      angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist. DuP 532 is more potent and longer 
      acting than losartan, another AII receptor antagonist currently undergoing phase 
      III clinical trials. The pharmacokinetics and the effect of the salt form on the 
      bioavailability of DuP 532 were determined in rats and dogs. In rats, the 
      absolute oral bioavailability and half-life averaged 8.0% and 3.5 h, 
      respectively, after the sodium bicarbonate solution and 7.6% and 3.6 h, 
      respectively, after the methyl cellulose suspension. In dogs, the absolute oral 
      bioavailability averaged 13.4% after the sodium bicarbonate solution and 11.9% 
      after hard gelatin capsules containing the neat powder. The data demonstrated 
      that there were no differences in bioavailability between the free acid and the 
      sodium salt of DuP 532 after oral administration to rats and dogs. The in vitro 
      metabolism of 14C-DuP 532 was evaluated with rat, dog, and human liver 
      microsomes. HPLC analyses with UV and radiochemical flow detection showed that 
      recovery of DuP 532 was greater than 99%, suggesting that there was little if any 
      metabolism by liver microsomal enzymes. Therefore, the low oral bioavailability 
      in rats was probably due to poor absorption of DuP 532 from the GI tract rather 
      than extensive metabolism.

TI  - Absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between losartan and 
      hydrochlorothiazide.
PG  - 1200-6
AB  - To support the use of a combination of losartan, a highly specific and selective 
      AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of 
      hypertension, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study was conducted. In this 
      open-label, randomized, three-period, crossover study, patients with mild to 
      moderate hypertension received a 12.5-mg tablet of hydrochlorothiazide, a 50-mg 
      losartan tablet, or a combination tablet of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 50 
      mg of losartan for 7 days. Twelve patients (age range, 35-55 years; mean age, 44 
      years) were allocated to treatment. Drug interactions were evaluated by comparing 
      the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for losartan and its 
      active metabolite, E-3174, when losartan (50 mg) was given alone or in 
      combination with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. The urinary recovery over the 
      24-hour period of hydrochlorothiazide was compared for hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 
      mg) given alone or in combination with 50 mg losartan. A clinically significant 
      interaction was defined as a treatment difference of more than 35%. There was no 
      evidence of a clinically significant effect of hydrochlorothiazide on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174, as the geometric mean AUC24 ratio (90% 
      confidence interval [CI]) was 1.02 (0.95, 1.09) for losartan and 1.02 (0.96, 
      1.09) for E-3174. Based on urinary recovery over a 24-hour period of 
      hydrochlorothiazide, losartan did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
      hydrochlorothiazide, as the geometric mean ratio of urinary hydrochlorothiazide 
      recovery (90% CI) was 0.898 (0.79, 1.20). There was a minor (17%) decrease in the 
      AUC24 of hydrochlorothiazide after administration of the combination tablet. 
      Coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and losartan was well tolerated.

TI  - Use of a cocktail probe to assess potential drug interactions with cytochrome 
      P450 after administration of belatacept, a costimulatory immunomodulator.
PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13097 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This open-label study investigated the effect of belatacept on cytokine 
      levels and on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, 
      dextromethorphan and midazolam, as CYP probe substrates after oral administration 
      of the Inje cocktail in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-two evaluable 
      subjects received the Inje cocktail on Days 1, 4, 7 and 11 and belatacept 
      infusion on Day 4. RESULTS: Since belatacept caused no major alterations to 
      cytokine levels, there were no major effects on CYP-substrate pharmacokinetics, 
      except for a slight (16-30%) increase in omeprazole exposure, which was probably 
      due to omeprazole-mediated, time-dependent CYP inhibition. Belatacept did not 
      cause major alterations in the pharmacokinetics, as measured by the geometric 
      mean ratios and associated 90% confidence interval for area under the plasma 
      concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity on Day 7 comparing 
      administration with and without belatacept for caffeine (1.002 [0.914, 1.098]), 
      dextromethorphan (1.031 [0.885, 1.200]), losartan (1.016 [0.938, 1.101)], 
      midazolam (0.968 [0.892, 1.049]) or their respective metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Therefore, no dose adjustments of CYP substrates are indicated with belatacept 
      coadministration.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and haemodynamic interactions between amlodipine and losartan in 
      human beings.
PG  - 345-352
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13244 [doi]
AB  - The combination of calcium channel blockers (CCB) and angiotensin receptor 
      blockers (ARB) for the treatment of hypertension showed improved efficacy and 
      safety. Amlodipine is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, whereas 
      losartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The potential pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between amlodipine and losartan were assessed. An open-label, 
      three-period, fixed-sequence trial was conducted. Amlodipine, losartan and 
      combined amlodipine and losartan were administered to 24 healthy male 
      participants during periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively, for 9 days each. The 
      pharmacokinetics of amlodipine, losartan and EXP-3174, an active metabolite of 
      losartan, were assessed at steady-state. Twenty participants completed the study 
      without serious adverse events. Losartan did not influence the exposure of 
      amlodipine at steady-state (AUC(τ) , 165.15 ng h/mL [amlodipine alone] vs 
      172.36 ng h/mL [combination], P = 0.389) [geometric mean ratio (GMR) (90% 
      confidence interval [CI]), 1.060 (0.954-1.178)]. In addition, the exposure of 
      EXP-3174 was not affected by amlodipine (AUC(τ) , 1159.46 ng h/mL vs 
      1105.10 ng h/mL, P = 0.295) (GMR [90% CI], 0.957 [0.891-1.027]). However, 
      amlodipine significantly decreased the exposure of losartan at steady-state 
      (AUC(τ) , 1241.50 ng h/mL vs 1082.02 ng h/mL, P = 0.006) (GMR [90% CI], 0.875 
      [0.813-0.942]) and increased oral clearance of losartan (84.65 L/h vs 97.26 L/h, 
      P = 0.002). Combination use of two drugs caused additive haemodynamic changes 
      compared to treatment of amlodipine or losartan alone. The co-administration of 
      amlodipine and losartan was tolerable and did not cause substantial 
      pharmacokinetic interaction, even though losartan disposition was affected. 
      Combination use of the two drugs caused additive haemodynamic changes compared to 
      monotherapy of amlodipine or losartan.

TI  - Determination of asperosaponin VI in rat plasma by HPLC-ESI-MS and its 
      application to preliminary pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 550-5
LID - 10.1002/bmc.1325 [doi]
AB  - Asperosaponin VI (also named akebia saponin D) is a typical bioactive 
      triterpenoid saponin isolated from the rhizome of Dipsacus asper Wall 
      (Dipsacaceae). In this work, a sensitive high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) assay has 
      been established for determination of asperosaponin VI in rat plasma. With 
      losartan as the internal standard (IS), plasma samples were prepared by protein 
      precipitation with methanol. Chromatographic separation was performed on a C(18) 
      column with a mobile phase of 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer containing 0.05% 
      formic acid-methanol (32 : 68, v/v). The analysis was performed on an ESI in the 
      selected ion monitoring mode using target ions at m/z 951.4 for asperosaponin VI 
      and m/z 423.2 for the IS. The calibration curve was linear over the range 3-1000 
      ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 3.0 ng/mL. The intra- and 
      inter-assay variability values were less than 9.5 and 7.8%, respectively. The 
      accuracies determined at the concentrations of 3.0, 100.0, 300.0 and 1000 ng/mL 
      for asperosaponin VI were within +/-15.0%. The validated method was successfully 
      applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats after oral administration of 
      asperosaponin VI.

TI  - Repeated administration of berberine inhibits cytochromes P450 in humans.
PG  - 213-7
LID - 10.1007/s00228-011-1108-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Berberine is a plant alkaloid that is widely used to treat 
      gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. 
      Many studies have reported interactions between berberine-containing products and 
      cytochromes P450 (CYPs), but little is known about whether berberine alters CYP 
      activities in humans, especially after repeated doses. METHODS: A two-phase 
      randomized-crossover clinical study in healthy male subjects was performed. After 
      2 weeks of berberine (300 mg, t.i.d., p.o.) administration, midazolam, 
      omeprazole, dextromethorphan, losartan, and caffeine were used to evaluate enzyme 
      activities of CYP3A4, 2C19, 2D6, 2C9, and CYP1A2, respectively. RESULTS: A 
      decrease in CYP2D6 activity was observed as the 0-8 h urinary 
      dextromethorphan/dextrorphan increased ninefold (P < 0.01). In addition, 
      losartan/E-3174 ratio doubled (P < 0.01) after BBR administration, indicating a 
      decrease in CYP2C9 activity. CYP3A4 activity was also inhibited, as the C(max), 
      AUC(0-∞), and AUC(0-12) of midazolam were increased 38% (P < 0.05), 40% 
      (P < 0.01), and 37% (P < 0.05) after BBR treatment, respectively. Compared with 
      the placebo period, the T(max) and T(1/2) of midazolam during BBR administration 
      were prolonged from 3.03 ± 0.27 to 3.66 ± 0.37 h and 0.66 ± 0.08 to 0.99 ± 0.09 
      h, respectively; the oral clearance of midazolam was decreased 27% (P < 0.05); 
      and the phenotypic indices of 1 h midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam increased 59% 
      (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of the other probe drugs between placebo and the 
      BBR-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated administration of berberine (300 mg, 
      t.i.d., p.o.) decreased CYP2D6, 2C9, and CYP3A4 activities. Drug-drug 
      interactions should be considered when berberine is administered.

TI  - Modelling gastric emptying: A pharmacokinetic model simultaneously describing 
      distribution of losartan and its active metabolite EXP-3174.
PG  - 193-202
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13321 [doi]
AB  - Losartan presents multiple peaks in the concentration-time profile. This 
      characteristic can be attributed to gastric emptying, which is known to 
      significantly affect the disposition of highly soluble and permeable compounds. 
      The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for 
      losartan and its active metabolite (EXP-3174) in order to describe the effect of 
      gastric emptying on their disposition. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was 
      performed using concentration-time data derived from a crossover bioequivalence 
      study in 31 volunteers after a single oral dose of 100 mg losartan potassium in 
      the fasted state. Delay differential equations (DDEs) were explored for the 
      description of losartan absorption and EXP-3174 formation, since when solved they 
      result in oscillatory behaviour. A two-compartment model preceded by a 
      pre-absorption compartment (referring to small intestine) adequately described 
      the observed concentration-time profiles of losartan. In the final model, a 
      sinusoidal equation was used for the description of gastric emptying in view of 
      its simplicity, leading to enhanced stability of the model and its capacity to 
      describe periodicity. In case of EXP-3174, a one-compartment model, with a 
      delayed first-order formation rate from losartan's central compartment, best 
      described its disposition. Using the model developed, it was shown through 
      simulations that changes in gastric emptying parameters lead to changes in the 
      C-t profiles of both compounds. In particular, plasma oscillations can be 
      enhanced or completely suppressed, simply by changing parameters affecting 
      gastric emptying.

PG  - 115-9
AB  - This was a 2-period randomized, crossover study in 8 healthy males to determine 
      the effects of cimetidine (400 mg q.i.d. for 6 days) on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamic effects of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan (100 
      mg). Cimetidine increased the AUC for losartan 18% without affecting the AUC for 
      E-3174, the active metabolite of losartan. The increase in plasma renin activity 
      following losartan was not affected by cimetidine (maximum mean increases 12.6 
      and 12.1 ng Ang I.ml-1.h-1 without and with cimetidine, respectively). These 
      results indicate that cimetidine does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics or 
      pharmacodynamics of losartan to a clinically significant extent.

PG  - 1233-56
AB  - DMP 811 exhibited high binding affinity for the angiotensin II subtype receptor 
      AT1 in rat adrenal tissues with an IC50 of 6 nM, but not for the subtype receptor 
      AT2. In the isolated rabbit aorta, DMP 811 inhibited the contractile response to 
      angiotensin II selectively and noncompetitively with a KB value of 0.1 nM. In 
      conscious renal hypertensive rats, DMP 811 decreased blood pressure with i.v. and 
      p.o. ED30s of 0.005 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively (p.o. ED30 for losartan = 0.59 
      mg/kg). In conscious furosemide-treated dogs, DMP 811 given either at 0.3 or 1 
      mg/kg p.o. decreased blood pressure. DMP 811 has oral bioavailabilities of 7 and 
      29% in rats and dogs, respectively, after a solution dose and 8 and 13%, 
      respectively, after a suspension or capsule dosing. Our study indicates that DMP 
      811 is a selective and insurmountable AT1 receptor antagonist and is a 20-fold 
      more potent orally-active antihypertensive agent than losartan.

TI  - Comparative pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of candesartan and losartan in 
      man.
PG  - 1075-83
AB  - The angiotensin II antagonistic effects of candesartan and losartan were compared 
      in-vivo after single and repeated doses. Effects were related to antagonistic 
      activity in plasma. In this double-blind, crossover study, 12 healthy male 
      volunteers received, in random order, daily oral doses of 8 mg candesartan 
      cilexetil or 50 mg losartan for seven days. On day 1 and day 8, dynamics and 
      kinetics were assessed up to 48 h after dosing. Antagonistic effect was 
      determined from the antagonist-induced rightward shifts of the diastolic blood 
      pressure response curves to exogenously administered angiotensin II measured as 
      the dose ratio (DR). The antagonistic activity in plasma was measured using an 
      ex-vivo/in-vitro radioreceptor assay. Specific high-performance liquid 
      chromatography assays determined plasma concentrations of candesartan, losartan 
      and its active metabolite EXP-3174. The pharmacokinetic properties of candesartan 
      and losartan were comparable and antagonistic activity in plasma almost identical 
      (ratio candesartan: losartan = 0.97 and 1-2 after single and multiple doses, 
      respectively). However, the antagonistic effects of candesartan and losartan 
      in-vivo were quite different. Twenty-four hours after single dosing with 
      candesartan a clinically relevant rightward shift in the angiotensin II 
      dose-response curve (DR= 3.2) occurred that was more pronounced than that 
      following losartan administration (DR=2.1, ratio candesartan: losartan= 1.65). 
      Twenty-four hours after multiple doses of candesartan or losartan, the values of 
      the DR were 4.8 and 2.3, respectively (ratio candesartan: losartan = 1.94). The 
      values of DR for candesartan were significantly higher compared with losartan 
      between 6 and 36h after a single dose and between 3 and 24 h post-dose following 
      multiple dose administration. A counter-clockwise hysteresis was apparent between 
      antagonistic activity in plasma and antagonistic effect. Despite equivalent 
      angiotensin II antagonistic activity in plasma, the pharmacodynamic effect of 
      candesartan cilexetil was greater than that of losartan. Candesartan appeared to 
      have a slower off-rate from the angiotensin AT1-receptor compared with losartan, 
      nevertheless differences in distributional phenomena or the extent of 
      insurmountable antagonistic activity cannot be ruled out.

      The best in vitro skin permeation profile was obtained with proniosomal 
      formulation PNG-2 in 24 h. The permeability parameters such as flux, permeability 
      coefficient, and enhancement ratio were significant for PNG-2 compared with other 
      formulations (P < 0.05). This optimized PNG-2 was fabricated in the form of 
      transdermal patch using HPMC gel as a suitable base. Proniosomal transdermal 
      therapeutic system (PNP-H) was found to be the optimized one as it gave better 
      release of drug and better permeation in a steady-state manner over a desired 
      period of time, that is, 24 h through rat skin. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of 
      PNP-H showed a significant increase in bioavailability (1.93 times) compared with 
      oral formulation of losartan potassium. The formulation appeared to be stable 
      when stored at room temperature (30 +/- 2 degrees C) and at refrigeration 
      temperature (4 +/- 2 degrees C) for 45 days.

TI  - ABCB1 c.2677G>T/c.3435C>T diplotype increases the early-phase oral absorption of 
      losartan.
PG  - 1187-1196
LID - 10.1007/s12272-020-01294-3 [doi]
AB  - Losartan has been shown to be a substrate of the drug-efflux transporter MDR1, 
      encoded by the ABCB1 gene. ABCB1 c.2677G>T and c.3435C>T variants are known to be 
      associated with reduced expression and function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We 
      investigated the effects of ABCB1 diplotype on the pharmacokinetics of losartan. 
      Thirty-eight healthy Korean volunteers with different ABCB1 diplotypes 
      [c.2677G> T and c.3435C>T; carriers of GG/CC (n = 13), GT/CT (n = 12) and TT/TT 
      (n = 13) diplotype] were recruited and administered a single 50 mg oral dose of 
      losartan potassium. Losartan and its active metabolite E-3174 samples in plasma 
      and urine were collected up to 10 and 8 h after drug administration, 
      respectively, and the concentrations of both samples were determined by HPLC 
      method. Significant differences were observed in C(max) of losartan and losartan 
      plus E-3174 (Lo + E) among the three diplotype groups (both P < 0.01). However, 
      the power of the performed test is less than the desired power (0.800). The 
      t(max) of losartan and E-3174 in three diplotype groups were also significantly 
      different (both P < 0.01). The AUC values of Lo + E were significantly different 
      among the three diplotype groups until 6 h after losartan administration 
      (P < 0.01). On the contrary, AUC at the periods of 8-10 h and 10 h-infinity of 
      Lo + E were significantly lower in the TT/TT group than in the GG/CC group. 
      Urinary excretion of losartan until 4 h after losartan administration in the 
      TT/TT group was higher than that of the GG/CC group. These results suggest that 
      c.2677G>T/c.3435C>T diplotypes of ABCB1 may significantly increase the 
      early-phase absorption of losartan, but not the total absorption.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction of losartan and glimepiride in rats 
      and its possible mechanism.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1159/000377637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan and glimepiride are commonly used drugs to treat chronic 
      diseases of hypertension and diabetes; they are both substrates of CYP2C9. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interaction of losartan 
      and glimepiride both in vitro (rat liver microsomes) and in vivo (healthy 
      Sprague-Dawley rats). METHODS: In rat liver microsomes, 1-10 μmol/l losartan and 
      glimepiride were coincubated, and the inhibitory effect was analyzed. In the 
      subsequent pharmacokinetic study, 15 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats received 
      administrations of 5 mg/kg losartan or 1 mg/kg glimepiride or a coadministration. 
      RESULTS: In the rat liver microsome system, glimepiride showed a slight 
      inhibition of losartan at concentrations of 1-10 μmol/l, whereas losartan 
      exhibited no inhibitory effect on glimepiride. In vivo, glimepiride did not 
      modify the plasma concentration of losartan and its metabolite E-3174. The 
      alteration of an increased AUC and Cmax was observed in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of glimepiride and hydroxy glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride did 
      not affect losartan pharmacokinetics in rats, while losartan potently altered 
      glimepiride metabolism; this result was inconsistent with the in vitro outcome. 
      The mechanism requires further investigation. In clinical settings, attention 
      should be paid to the interaction of these two drugs in the human body as well as 
      the possible adverse reactions of glimepiride.

TI  - Evaluation of potential losartan-phenytoin drug interactions in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 238-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenytoin, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 substrate, has a narrow 
      therapeutic index and nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Therefore there is the 
      potential for significant concentration-related adverse effects when phenytoin is 
      coadministered with other CYP2C9 substrates. Losartan, an antihypertensive agent, 
      is also a substrate for CYP2C9. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the 
      effects of losartan on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin and the effects of 
      phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of losartan in a healthy population of 
      volunteers. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, 3-period crossover study was 
      conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with phenytoin alone, phenytoin in combination 
      with losartan, and losartan alone. Each treatment was given for 10 days with a 
      3-week washout period between treatments. On day 10, plasma concentrations of 
      phenytoin and plasma and urine concentrations of losartan and its active 
      carboxylic-acid metabolite E3174 were measured to determine steady-state 
      pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: Coadministration of losartan had no effect 
      on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin. Coadministration of phenytoin increased the 
      mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours 
      [AUC(0-24)] of losartan by 17% (355 +/- 220 ng x h/mL versus 427 +/- 177 ng x 
      h/mL; P =.1), but this difference was not statistically significant. In the 14 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects, the mean AUC(0-24) of losartan was increased by 29% (284 
      +/- 84 ng x h/mL versus 402 +/- 128 ng x h/mL; P =.008). Coadministration of 
      phenytoin significantly reduced the AUC(0-24) of E3174 by 63% (1254 +/- 256 ng x 
      h/mL versus 466 +/- 174 ng x h/mL; P =.0001) and the formation clearance of 
      losartan to E3174 (1.91 +/- 0.8 mL/h per kilogram versus 0.62 +/- 0.4 mL/h per 
      kilogram; P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Losartan, a CYP2C9 substrate, had no effect on 
      the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin. However, phenytoin inhibited the 
      CYP2C9-mediated conversion of losartan to E3174.

TI  - Simultaneous and comprehensive in vivo analysis of cytochrome P450 activity by 
      using a cocktail approach in rats.
PG  - 228-36
LID - 10.1002/bdd.1888 [doi]
AB  - A cocktail approach can detect the activities of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      isoforms following the administration of multiple CYP-specific substrates in a 
      single experiment. This study aimed to develop a simultaneous and comprehensive 
      in vivo analysis of CYP activity in rats. The rats received an oral 
      administration of losartan (10 mg/kg) and omeprazole (40 mg/kg). Caffeine (1 
      mg/kg), dextromethorphan (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg) were administered 15 
      min later. In the drug-interaction phase, the rats were treated orally with 
      dexamethasone (80 mg/kg) 24 h before, or with ketoconazole (10 mg/kg), 
      fluvoxamine (100 mg kg) or fluconazole (10 mg/kg) 1 h before the administration 
      of cocktail drugs. The concentrations of the drugs and their metabolites were 
      determined by LC/MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of five CYP substrates and their 
      metabolites were simultaneously evaluated after the oral drug administration. 
      Fluvoxamine and fluconazole significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of caffeine, 
      and the AUC of omeprazole and midazolam. Dexamethasone significantly increased 
      Cmax and AUC of losartan, while it decreased the Cmax of midazolam. Ketoconazole 
      showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the tested 
      drugs. In conclusion, a cocktail approach was developed for simultaneous and 
      comprehensive analysis of the activities of multiple CYP isoforms in rats. In 
      this approach, the effects of inhibitors and an inducer of various CYP isoforms 
      were examined. Although further studies are necessary to predict the effects in 
      humans, this approach may be expected to serve as a convenient method for 
      detecting drug-drug interactions in rats.

TI  - Human bioequivalence evaluation of two losartan potassium tablets under fasting 
      conditions.
PG  - 190-5
AB  - The bioequivalence of two different tablet formulations containing losartan 
      potassium 100 mg was determined in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose in 
      a randomized crossover study. Test and reference products were administered to 60 
      volunteers with 240 ml water after overnight fasting. Plasma concentrations of 
      losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite were monitored over a period 
      of 36 h after drug administration by validated LC/MS/MS analytical method. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC0-t/AUC0-∞, tmax, Kel and t½ 
      were determined from plasma concentration time profile of both formulations for 
      losartan and its active metabolite losartan carboxylic acid and were found to be 
      in good agreement. The carboxylic acid metabolite was considered for profiling 
      purpose only. The analysis of variance did not show any significant difference 
      between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of Cmax 
      (84.89-104.09%), AUC0-t (95.84-102.84%) and AUC0-∞ (96.43-103.25%) values for 
      losartan between the test and reference products were within the 80-125% 
      interval, satisfying the bioequivalence criteria of the US FDA guidelines. These 
      results indicate that the test and the reference products of losartan potassium 
      are bioequivalent and, thus, may be prescribed interchangeably.

TI  - Tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan as probes of CYP2C9 activity in humans.
PG  - 84-91
AB  - The metabolic activity of CYP2C9 in 16 subjects expressing four different 
      genotypes (CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, and *2/*2) was evaluated. Single oral doses 
      of tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan were administered in a randomized, 
      crossover design. Plasma and urine were collected over 24 hours. The urinary 
      metabolic ratio and amount of metabolite(s) excreted were correlated with 
      formation clearance. The formation clearance of tolbutamide to its 
      CYP2C9-mediated metabolites demonstrated a stronger association with genotype 
      compared to flurbiprofen and losartan, respectively (r2 = 0.64 vs. 0.53 vs. 
      0.42). A statistically significant correlation was observed between formation 
      clearance of tolbutamide and the 0- to 12-hour urinary amount of 
      4'-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (r = 0.84). Compared to tolbutamide, 
      the correlations observed between the respective measures of flurbiprofen and 
      losartan metabolism were not as strong. Tolbutamide is a better CYP2C9 probe than 
      flurbiprofen and losartan, and the 0- to 12-hour amount of 4'-hydroxytolbutamide 
      and carboxytolbutamide is the best urinary measure of its metabolism.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide, 
      omeprazole, digoxin and warfarin in healthy subjects.
PG  - 659-66
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0080-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel iron-based phosphate binder sucroferric oxyhydroxide is 
      being investigated for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Patients with chronic 
      kidney disease often have multiple comorbidities that may necessitate the daily 
      use of several types of medication. Therefore, the potential pharmacokinetic 
      drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and selected drugs 
      commonly taken by dialysis patients were investigated. METHODS: Five Phase I, 
      single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover studies in healthy 
      volunteers investigated the effect of a single dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide 1 
      g (based on iron content) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan 100 mg, furosemide 
      40 mg, omeprazole 40 mg, digoxin 0.5 mg and warfarin 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters [including area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 
      time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-∞) and from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24)] for 
      these drugs were determined: alone in the presence of food; with sucroferric 
      oxyhydroxide in the presence of food; 2 h after food and sucroferric oxyhydroxide 
      administration. RESULTS: Systemic exposure based on AUC0-∞ for all drugs, and 
      AUC0-24 for all drugs except omeprazole (for which AUC 0-8 h was measured), was 
      unaffected to a clinically significant extent by the presence of sucroferric 
      oxyhydroxide, irrespective of whether sucroferric oxyhydroxide was administered 
      with the drug or 2 h earlier. CONCLUSIONS: There is a low risk of drug-drug 
      interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide, digoxin 
      and warfarin. There is also a low risk of drug-drug interaction with omeprazole 
      (based on AUC0-∞ values). Therefore, sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be administered 
      concomitantly without the need to adjust the dosage regimens of these drugs.

TI  - Clinical pharmacology of multiple-dose losartan, an angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 403-8
AB  - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations of multiple doses of 
      losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, were examined in nine patients 
      with essential hypertension. Participants were given placebo once daily for the 
      first 7 days (from day -7 to day -1), and then 50 mg of losartan for the next 9 
      days (from day 1 to day 9). The 24-hour blood pressure was measured on days -1, 
      1, and 7 and blood samples for measurement of losartan and its active metabolite, 
      E-3174, were obtained on days 1 and 7. Plasma concentrations of uric acid and 
      plasma clearance were determined before and during treatment with losartan, and 
      at the end of the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters after the seventh dose, 
      including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (tmax) of losartan 
      and E-3174, did not differ significantly from those after the first dose. The 
      blood pressure lowering effect of losartan, however, was significantly greater 
      after the seventh dose than after the first dose. Plasma uric acid decreased and 
      its plasma clearance (ClUA) increased significantly during repeated 
      administration with losartan. These values returned to pretreatment levels after 
      the end of treatment. These results suggest that although the pharmacokinetic 
      profiles of losartan and E-3174 do not change during repeated administration, the 
      blood pressure lowering effect in hypertensive patients is greater after multiple 
      doses than after a single dose.

TI  - Prediction of the effects of genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of 
      CYP2C9 substrates from in vitro data.
PG  - 822-35
LID - 10.1007/s11095-008-9781-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The *2 and *3 alleles of CYP2C9, with decreased enzymatic activity, are 
      highly polymorphic and contribute to inter-individual differences in 
      pharmacotherapy of CYP2C9 substrates. Here, we sought for a simplified 
      theoretical method to predict the pharmacokinetic changes with minimal in vivo 
      data. METHODS: The changes in clearances of CYP2C9 substrates in subjects with 
      these alleles were quantitatively estimated by parameters from literature data: 
      intrinsic metabolic clearance and the enzyme expression level of mutated CYP2C9, 
      contribution of CYP2C9 to the CYP-mediated clearance (f (m2C9)), and the 
      contribution of the dominant metabolic pathways to the total clearance (f (h)). 
      To validate the accuracy of our prediction, the changes were compared to reported 
      in vivo values. RESULTS: Sufficient data were available for nine substrates: 
      celecoxib, diclofenac, S-flurbiprofen, losartan, S-phenprocoumon, phenytoin, 
      tolbutamide, torsemide, and S-warfarin. These predicted values, either using the 
      intrinsic clearance specific to each substrate, or the averaged values (*2: 0.66, 
      *3: 0.13, (ratio to *1)), correlated well with observed values (r (2) = 0.812, 
      0.786, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical method well estimated the 
      quantitative changes in pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 substrates in subjects with 
      mutated alleles of CYP2C9. This can be applied to drug development even from the 
      early clinical phases.

LID - 10.1111/bcp.14862 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effect of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) on drug metabolism by comparing the pharmacokinetics of patients with 
      severe COPD with healthy volunteers and using the modified Inje drug cocktail. 
      METHODS: This was a single-centre pharmacokinetic study with 12 healthy 
      participants and 7 participants with GOLD D COPD. Midazolam 1 mg, 
      dextromethorphan 30 mg, losartan 25 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, caffeine 130 mg and 
      paracetamol 1000 mg were simultaneously administered and intensive 
      pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted over 8 hours. Drug metabolism by CYP3A4, 
      CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 in participants with COPD were 
      compared with phenotypes in healthy controls. RESULTS: The oral clearance (95% 
      confidence interval) in participants with COPD relative to controls was: 
      midazolam 63% (60-67%); dextromethorphan 72% (40-103%); losartan 53% (52-55%); 
      omeprazole 35% (31-39%); caffeine 52% (50-53%); and paracetamol 73% (72-74%). 
      There was a 5-fold increase in AUC for omeprazole and approximately 2-fold 
      increases for caffeine, losartan, dextromethorphan, and midazolam. The AUC of 
      paracetamol, which is mostly glucuronidated, was increased by about 60%. 
      CONCLUSION: Severe COPD is associated with a clinically significant reduction in 
      oral drug clearance. This may be greater for cytochrome P450 substrates than for 
      glucuronidated drugs. This supports reduced starting doses when prescribing for 
      patients with severe COPD.

TI  - [In vivo study of the pharmacokinetic interaction of afobazole and losartan 
      (cytochrome CYP2C9 substrate)].
PG  - 35-7
AB  - The influence of afobazole on isoenzyme CYP2C9 production in rats was studied 
      using losartan as the marker drug. Single dose of losartan was administered 
      orally without afobazole in a dose of 30 mg/kg and in the same single (30 mg/kg) 
      on the background of 3- and 4-day administration of afobazole in a dose of 5, 25, 
      75, 100, and 125 mg/kg. At 5 mg/kg (effective dose for anxiolytic effect), 
      afobazole did not cause any induction/inhibition effect on CYP2C9 isoenzyme. A 
      multiple increase in afobazole dose was manifested by a moderate induction 
      effect. The maximum induction effect of afobazole was achieved in a dose of 75 
      mg/kg. At doses above 75 mg/kg, the induction effect of afobazole was less 
      pronounced.

TI  - Saliva versus plasma pharmacokinetics: theory and application of a salivary 
      excretion classification system.
PG  - 2358-63
LID - 10.1021/mp300250r [doi]
AB  - The aims of this work were to study pharmacokinetics of randomly selected drugs 
      in plasma and saliva samples in healthy human volunteers, and to introduce a 
      Salivary Excretion Classification System. Saliva and plasma samples were 
      collected for 3-5 half-life values of sitagliptin, cinacalcet, metformin, 
      montelukast, tolterodine, hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), lornoxicam, azithromycin, 
      diacerhein, rosuvastatin, cloxacillin, losartan and tamsulosin after oral dosing. 
      Saliva and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental 
      analysis using the Kinetica program. Effective intestinal permeability (Peff) 
      values were estimated by the Nelder-Mead algorithm of the Parameter Estimation 
      module using the SimCYP program. Peff values were optimized to predict the actual 
      average plasma profile of each drug. All other physicochemical factors were kept 
      constant during the minimization processes. Sitagliptin, cinacalcet, metformin, 
      tolterodine, HCT, azithromycin, rosuvastatin and cloxacillin had salivary 
      excretion with correlation coefficients of 0.59-0.99 between saliva and plasma 
      concentrations. On the other hand, montelukast, lornoxicam, diacerhein, losartan 
      and tamsulosin showed no salivary excretion. Estimated Peff ranged 0.16-44.16 × 
      10(-4) cm/s, while reported fraction unbound to plasma proteins (fu) ranged 
      0.01-0.99 for the drugs under investigation. Saliva/plasma concentrations ratios 
      ranged 0.11-13.4, in agreement with drug protein binding and permeability. A 
      Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) was suggested based on drug high 
      (H)/low (L) permeability and high (H)/low (L) fraction unbound to plasma 
      proteins, which classifies drugs into 4 classes. Drugs that fall into class I 
      (H/H), II (L/H) or III (H/L) are subjected to salivary excretion, while those 
      falling into class IV (L/L) are not. Additional data from literature was also 
      analyzed, and all results were in agreement with the suggested SECS. Moreover, a 
      polynomial relationship with correlation coefficient of 0.99 is obtained between 
      S* and C*, where S* and C* are saliva and concentration dimensionless numbers 
      respectively. The proposed Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) can be 
      used as a guide for drug salivary excretion. Future work is planned to test these 
      initial findings, and demonstrate SECS robustness across a range of carefully 
      selected (based on physicochemical properties) drugs that fall into classes I, II 
      or III.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma by 
      LC/MS/MS with electrospray ionization and its application to pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 415-27
AB  - A method based on a simple liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography with negative ion electrospray ionization 
      tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection was developed for the 
      simultaneous determination of losartan (LOS) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 
      human plasma, using valsartan (VAL) and chlorthalidone (CHTD) as an internal 
      standard, respectively. The acquisition was performed in multiple reactions 
      monitoring (MRM) and the limit of quantification was 4 ng/mL for both LOS and 
      HCTZ. The method was linear in the studied range (4-800 ng/mL for LOS and 4-500 
      ng/mL for HCTZ). The intra-assay precisions ranged from 2.6-11.9% for LOS and 
      1.4-8.2% for HCTZ, while the inter-assay precisions ranged from 1.0-8.0% for LOS 
      and 2.5-7.7% for HCTZ. The intra-assay accuracies ranged from 91.3 to 107.6% for 
      LOS and 91.5 to 105.8% for HCTZ, while the inter-assay accuracies ranged from 
      99.9 to 106.4% for LOS and 97.4 to 101.4% for HCTZ. The analytical method was 
      applied to a bioequivalence study, in which 28 healthy adult volunteers (14 men) 
      received single oral doses (100 mg LOS + 25 mg HCTZ) of reference and test 
      formulations, in an open, two-period, balanced randomized, crossover protocol. 
      Based on the 90% confidence interval of the individual ratios for Cmax and 
      AUC0-inf, it was concluded that the test formulation is bioequivalent to the 
      reference Hyzaar formulation with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of 
      both LOS and HCTZ.

TI  - Evaluation of potential herbal-drug interactions of a standardized propolis 
      extract (EPP-AF®) using an in vivo cocktail approach.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Propolis has been employed extensively in many 
      cultures since ancient times as antiseptic, wound healing, anti-pyretic and 
      others due to its biological and pharmacological properties, such as 
      immunomodulatory, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, 
      antiviral, antifungal, antiparasite activities. But despite its broad and 
      traditional use, there is little knowledge about its potential interaction with 
      prescription drugs. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main objective of this work was to 
      study the potential herbal-drug interactions (HDIs) of EPP-AF® using an in vivo 
      assay with a cocktail approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subtherapeutic doses of 
      caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, metoprolol, midazolam and fexofenadine were used. 
      Sixteen healthy adult volunteers were investigated before and after exposure to 
      orally administered 125 mg/8 h (375 mg/day) EPP-AF® for 15 days. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were calculated based on plasma concentration versus time (AUC) 
      curves. RESULTS: After exposure to EPP-AF®, it was observed decrease in the 
      AUC(0-∞) of fexofenadine, caffeine and losartan of approximately 18% 
      (62.20 × 51.00 h.ng/mL), 8% (1085 × 999 h.ng/mL) and 13% (9.01 × 7.86 h.ng/mL), 
      respectively, with all 90% CIs within the equivalence range of 0.80-1.25. On the 
      other hand, omeprazole and midazolam exhibited an increase in AUC(0-∞) of, 
      respectively, approximately 18% (18.90 × 22.30 h.ng/mL) and 14% 
      (1.25 × 1.43 h.ng/mL), with the upper bounds of 90% CIs slightly above 1.25. 
      Changes in pharmacokinetics of metoprolol or its metabolite α-hydroxymetoprolol 
      were not statistically significant and their 90% CIs were within the equivalence 
      range of 0.80-1.25. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study shows that EPP-AF® does 
      not clinically change CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A activities, once, 
      despite statistical significant, the magnitude of the changes in AUC values after 
      EPP-AF® were all below 20% and therefore may be considered safe regarding 
      potential interactions involving these enzymes. Besides, to the best of our 
      knowledge this is the first study to assess potential HDIs with propolis.

TI  - The impact of hepatic uptake on the pharmacokinetics of organic anions.
PG  - 1930-8

AB  - The disposition of seven marketed and two AstraZeneca acid (organic anion) 
      compounds with a range of volume of distribution at steady state (V(ss)) and 
      clearance have been profiled in rat and dog. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
      along with liver and muscle tissue levels were collected, and their contributions 
      to total V(ss) were calculated. The physiologically based prediction of V(ss) 
      correlated (all predictions within 2-fold) with the V(ss) obtained from plasma PK 
      analysis. The V(ss) of the acid drugs with atypically high values could be 
      explained by significant sequestering of compound to the liver. A "media loss" in 
      the in vitro hepatocyte assay that monitors loss of compound from the incubation 
      media along with physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling was assessed for its 
      ability to accurately predict the impact of hepatic uptake on both clearance and 
      V(ss). This methodology significantly improved the prediction of metabolic in 
      vivo clearance compared with standard hepatocyte scaling approaches that do not 
      take into account hepatic uptake. Predictions of V(ss) from the media loss assay 
      also correlate with the measured values from plasma PK analysis. However, hepatic 
      uptake will have little overall impact on half-life, because of the concomitant 
      impact on both Cl and V(ss), as long as hepatic extraction is not high. The 
      methodology described here is particularly useful when there is no allometric 
      relationship between species as a result of interspecies differences in liver 
      uptake. In this situation, the potential use of human hepatocytes combined with 
      PBPK modeling avoids the question of which species pharmacokinetics is most 
      predictive to humans.

TI  - Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery influenced pharmacokinetics of 
      several drugs given as a cocktail with the highest impact observed for CYP1A2, 
      CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 substrates.
PG  - 123-132

AB  - There is a lack of information about the changes in drug pharmacokinetics and 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism after bariatric surgery. Here, we investigated 
      the effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery on 
      pharmacokinetics of nine drugs given simultaneously which may reveal changes in 
      the activities of the main CYPs. Eight obese subjects undergoing LRYGB received 
      an oral cocktail containing nine drugs, substrates of various CYPs: melatonin 
      (CYP1A2), nicotine (CYP2A6), bupropion (CYP2B6), repaglinide (CYP2C8), losartan 
      (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19/CYP3A4), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone 
      (CYP2E1) and midazolam (CYP3A). The 6-hours pharmacokinetic profiles in serum and 
      urine of each drug or corresponding metabolite as well as their metabolic ratios 
      were compared before surgery with those at a median 1 year later. LRYGB exerted 
      variable effects on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The geometric mean 
      AUC(0-6) (90% confidence interval) of melatonin, bupropion, repaglinide, 
      chlorzoxazone and midazolam after LRYGB was 27 (19%-41%), 54 (43%-67%), 44 
      (29%-66%), 160 (129%-197%) and 74 (62%-90%) of the pre-surgery values, 
      respectively. The pharmacokinetics of losartan, omeprazole and dextromethorphan 
      did not change in response to surgery. Nicotine was not detected in serum, while 
      geometric mean of AUC(0-6) of its metabolite, cotinine, increased by 1.7 times 
      after surgery. There were 3.6- and 1.3-fold increases in the AUC ratios of 
      6-hydroxymelatonin/melatonin and hydroxybupropion/bupropion, respectively. The 
      cocktail revealed multiple pharmacokinetic changes occurring after LRYGB with the 
      greatest effects observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 substrates. Future 
      studies should be focused on CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 to clarify the 
      changes in activities of these enzymes after LRYGB.

TI  - Phenobarbital minimally alters plasma concentrations of losartan and its active 
      metabolite E-3174.
PG  - 268-74
AB  - Losartan, a selective angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonist for hypertension, 
      is metabolized to an active carboxylic acid metabolite, E-3174, which has a 
      longer half-life. To investigate the effects of induction of cytochrome P450 on 
      the metabolism of losartan, we evaluated the effects of phenobarbital on the 
      plasma profiles of losartan and E-3174 in 15 healthy male subjects. Ten subjects 
      received a single 100 mg oral dose of losartan before and during phenobarbital 
      administration (100 mg/day for 16 days), and five subjects received losartan 
      before and during placebo. Urinary excretion of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol (relative 
      to 17-hydroxycorticosteroids) was measured as an endogenous marker of cytochrome 
      P450 induction. The geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      ratios (with/without phenobarbital and 90% confidence intervals) for losartan and 
      its metabolite (E-3174) were 0.795 (0.723, 0.875) and 0.799 (0.778, 0.820), 
      respectively, indicating that phenobarbital treatment significantly but to a 
      clinically minor extent reduced plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174 
      (p<0.01). Half-life values of losartan and E-3174 were unchanged. The ratio of 
      6-beta-hydroxycortisol to 17-hydroxycorticosteroids doubled in the phenobarbital 
      group (p < 0.001) and did not change appreciably in the placebo group.

AB  - The discovery, in vitro and in vivo studies of the highly potent AT(1) antagonist 
      12a (BR-A-657, Fimasartan) antagonists are presented. A series of 
      pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives as losartan analogue were synthesized and 
      evaluated for a novel class of AT(1) receptor antagonists. Among them, 12a 
      containing thioamido moiety displayed both high in vitro functional antagonism 
      and binding affinity [IC(50)=0.42 and 0.13 nM, respectively] and inhibited 
      strongly in vivo AngII-induced pressor response in pithed rats with an ED(50) of 
      0.018 mg/kg. Moreover, in vivo evaluation in furosemide-treated rat and conscious 
      renal hypertensive rat models and the pharmacokinetic study showed that 12a is a 
      highly potent and orally active AT(1) selective antagonist having stronger in 
      vivo potency than losartan.

AB  - Polypill is a fixed-dose combination that contains three or more active 
      ingredients used as a single daily pill to achieve a large effect in preventing 
      cardiovascular disease with minimal adverse effects. A novel and accurate liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method using electrospray ionization mode 
      has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of amlodipine 
      (AMD), valsartan (VAL) using losartan (LOS) as an internal standard (IS), and 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) using furosemide (FSD) as an IS. The separation was 
      carried on Aquasil C(18) (50 mm×2.1 mm, 5 µm) reversed phase column using 
      acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid (50:50, v/v) as the mobile 
      phase. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy and precision 
      over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng/mL. The intra and inter-day precision 
      and accuracy, stability and extraction recoveries of all the analytes were in the 
      acceptable range. This method can be successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic 
      study of AMD, VAL and HCT when given as a polypill.

TI  - Losartan does not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin.
PG  - 1008-15
AB  - Losartan, on orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist is 
      being developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of hypertension and 
      heart failure. Many patients requiring anticoagulant therapy with warfarin also 
      may have hypertension or heart failure, and thus, are potential candidates for 
      losartan therapy. This study was designed to investigate whether losartan at 
      likely dosage levels would alter the anticoagulant response to warfarin. In a 
      two-period, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, ten healthy male 
      subjects received a single oral dose of 30 mg warfarin sodium on the seventh day 
      of a 13-day treatment with losartan, 100 mg daily by mouth, or placebo. Multiple 
      plasma samples were collected over a 6-day period after both warfarin doses for 
      the measurements of R- and S-warfarin concentrations and prothrombin times. The 
      pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin were comparable in the absence and presence 
      of losartan (no significant effects of losartan on area under the curve, Cmax, or 
      tmax). Losartan also had no significant effect on the anticoagulant effect of 
      warfarin, as assessed by the area under the prothrombin time versus time curve 
      and the maximum response for prothrombin time. The lack of pharmacokinetic or 
      pharmacodynamic interaction between warfarin and losartan observed in this 
      investigation suggests that a clinically important interaction between these 
      drugs is unlikely to occur in patients requiring concomitant administration of 
      both drugs.

TI  - Investigating the Impact of Gastric Emptying on Pharmacokinetic Parameters Using 
      Delay Differential Equations and Principal Component Analysis.
PG  - 451-458
LID - 10.1007/s13318-021-00683-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Losartan presents multiple peaks after single oral 
      administration, which can be attributed to gastric emptying. The aim of this 
      study was to describe the multiple peak phenomenon of losartan using a delay 
      differential model and a model with sine function. The impact of gastric emptying 
      on pharmacokinetic parameters was investigated by applying principal component 
      analysis to the individual parameter estimates. METHODS: Using Monolix(TM), two 
      population pharmacokinetic models were developed to describe the multiple peak 
      phenomenon; the first using delay differential equations and the second using a 
      sine function. Matlab(®) delay differential equation solver was used to 
      arithmetically solve both functions. Principal component analysis and all 
      statistical analyses were performed in the R language. RESULTS: The description 
      of losartan multiple peaks can be achieved by the use of either delay 
      differential equations or typical sine wave functions. Principal component 
      analysis unveiled the impact of gastric emptying on the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters. In the case of the delay differential equation model, a negative 
      relationship was found between the constant delay tau1 and the parameters 
      reflecting rate and extent of absorption (i.e., area under the curve [AUC], peak 
      plasma concentration [C(max)], and the absorption rate constant). Similar results 
      were obtained from the sine model, where a higher amplitude and lower period 
      (i.e., higher frequency) of gastric emptying were associated with higher AUC and 
      C(max) values. CONCLUSIONS: The observed multiple peaks for certain drugs like 
      losartan can be attributed to gastric emptying. Parameters describing gastric 
      emptying can be associated with pharmacokinetic metrics like AUC and C(max).

TI  - Drug-disease interactions: losartan effect is not downregulated by rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 1344-55
AB  - Inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, reduce response to calcium 
      channel and beta-adrenergic antagonists but not the angiotensin II type 1 
      receptor (AT(1)R) antagonist valsartan. Inflammation also reduces clearance of 
      some drugs or active metabolite, thereby reducing response. Active (n = 14) and 
      controlled rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12) and healthy subjects (n = 12) received 
      losartan (100 mg). Blood pressures were measured, and samples were taken for 
      pharmacokinetic and inflammatory mediator concentration determination. Active 
      disease significantly increased arthritic index, nitric oxide, and Creactive 
      protein. Although no between-group difference in plasma losartan 
      concentration-time curves was observed, concentrations of the active metabolite, 
      EXP 3174, were significantly reduced by arthritis. This, however, was not 
      accompanied by reduced clinical response. One subject produced no detectable 
      concentrations of EXP 3174 likely due to insufficient CYP2C9 activity. Despite 
      reduced concentrations of the active metabolite, AT1R antagonists potency does 
      not appear to be reduced by inflammation.

TI  - Potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions of Nigella Sativa and 
      Trigonella Foenum-graecum with losartan in L-NAME induced hypertensive rats.
PG  - 2544-2550
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.05.009 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this investigation was to study whether Nigella Sativa and 
      Trigonella Foenum-graecum, could modulate the losartan pharmacodynamic (PD) and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) in experimental L-NAME induced hypertensive rats. For in 
      vivo study, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of rats was measured by the 
      "tail-cuff system" after the treatment of rats with herb alone and 
      herb + losartan in hypertensive rats. The SBP of rats treated with 
      L-NAME + losartan also recorded. For the PK study, blood samples were obtained 
      for up to 12 h to determine the concentrations of the drug, and various PK 
      parameters were calculated. The data displayed that the SBP was significantly 
      (p < 0.05) decreased in the rats when administered with L-NAME + N. Sativa or 
      L-NAME + T. Foenum-graecum in contrast to the rats administered with L-NAME 
      alone. A more prominent decline (p < 0.05) in SBP was detected in rats 
      administered with L-NAME + N. Sativa + losartan and L-NAME + T. 
      Foenum-graecum + losartan. In a PK study, higher losartan C(max) and AUC(0-t) 
      were noted in rats treated with N. Sativa + losartan and T. 
      Foenum-graecum + losartan, although the difference was not significant in 
      contrast to the control group. This study proposed that the interaction between 
      N. Sativa & losartan and T. Foenum-graecum & losartan could take place on 
      concurrent administration; consequently, the dose of losartan may need to be 
      accustomed when they are utilized simultaneously.

AB  - The aim of this study was to formulate and evaluate SR matrix pellets containing 
      losartan potassium (LP) solid dispersion using extrusion-spheronization technique 
      to minimize the fluctuation of its plasma concentration. LP solid dispersions 
      were prepared by using different hydrophobic polymers at different weight ratios 
      (0.5, 1, 2, and 5%). LP-Eudragit RS solid dispersion at 1:5 ratio resulted in 
      slower drug release (only 20% of LP was released in about 8 h). Different 
      concentrations of hydrophilic polymer, PEG 6000, were mixed with Avicel(®) PH 101 
      to prepare the LP SR matrix pellets containing solid dispersion using 3(2) full 
      factorial design to evaluate the effects of formulation parameters on the pellets 
      attributes. The magnitude of torque for the pellet wet masses and binder ratio 
      were decreased significantly with increasing PEG 6000 concentration. LP sustained 
      release pellet formula composed of 9.24% PEG 6000 and 8 × 10(-9)% PVP K30 
      solution was chosen as optimized formula. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that 
      calculated t (max) was 9.72 ± 2.22 h from the optimized sustained release pellets 
      compared to 2.11 ± 0.49 h in case of Cozaar(®) immediate release tablet, 
      indicating a slower release of the LP from pellets.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination of Five Cytochrome P450 Probe Substrates and Their 
      Metabolites and Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide Probe Substrate in Human 
      Plasma Using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.

AB  - A rapid and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      method for the simultaneous determination of organic anion transporting 
      polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and cytochrome P450 (P450) probe substrates and their 
      phase I metabolites in human plasma was developed. The OATP1B1 (pitavastatin) and 
      five P450 probe substrates, caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole 
      (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A) and their metabolites 
      were extracted from human plasma (50 µL) using methanol. Analytes were separated 
      on a C18 column followed by selected reaction monitoring detection using MS/MS. 
      All analytes were separated simultaneously within a 9 min run time. The developed 
      method was fully validated over the expected clinical concentration range for all 
      analytes tested. The intra- and inter-day precisions for all analytes were lower 
      than 11.3% and 8.82%, respectively, and accuracy was 88.5⁻117.3% and 96.1⁻109.2%, 
      respectively. The lower limit of quantitation was 0.05 ng/mL for 
      dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, midazolam, and 1'-hydroxymidazolam; 0.5 ng/mL for 
      losartan, EXP-3174, omeprazole, 5'-hydroxyomeprazole, and pitavastatin; and 5 
      ng/mL for caffeine and paraxanthine. The method was successfully used in a 
      pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects after oral doses of five P450 and 
      OATP1B1 probes. This analytical method provides a simple, sensitive, and accurate 
      tool for the determination of OATP1B1 and five major P450 activities in vivo drug 
      interaction studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and blood pressure response of losartan in end-stage renal 
      disease.
PG  - 519-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is a selective angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist currently 
      employed in the management of essential hypertension. This compound is in common 
      use in populations with renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan 
      in patients with ESRD in order to establish administration guidelines. METHODS: 
      Patients were administered losartan 100 mg/day for 7 days, and after the seventh 
      and final dose pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for both losartan and 
      its active metabolite E-3174. During the study, the haemodialytic clearances of 
      losartan and E-3174 were measured during a standard 4-hour dialysis session. 
      Neurohumoral and biochemical changes were assessed during losartan 
      administration. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 in 
      haemodialysis patients did not alter to a clinically significant level. Losartan 
      administration was accompanied by a decline in plasma aldosterone level as well 
      as by an increase in plasma renin activity. Losartan administration resulted in a 
      decline in plasma uric acid level, despite the fact that the study participants 
      had no residual renal function. Losartan and E-3174 were not dialysable. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 are minimally altered in 
      ESRD; thus, dosage adjustment is not required in the presence of advanced 
      dialysis-dependent renal failure. In addition, postdialysis supplementation is 
      not required for losartan because of the negligible dialysability of losartan and 
      E-3174.

TI  - Pediatric Cytochrome P450 Activity Alterations in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.
PG  - 1317-1325
LID - 10.1124/dmd.117.077644 [doi]
AB  - Variable drug responses depend on individual variation in the activity of 
      drug-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). As the most 
      common chronic liver disease in children and adults, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
      (NASH) has been identified as a source of significant interindividual variation 
      in hepatic drug metabolism. Compared with adults, children present age-related 
      differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine the impact of fatty liver disease severity on the activity of a 
      variety of CYP enzymes in children and adolescents. Healthy and nonalcoholic 
      fatty liver disease pediatric subjects aged 12-21 years inclusive received an 
      oral cocktail of four probe drugs: caffeine (CYP1A2, 100 mg), omeprazole 
      (CYP2C19, 20 mg), losartan (CYP2C9, 25 mg), and midazolam (CYP3A4, 2 mg). Venous 
      blood and urine were collected before administration and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours 
      after administration. Concentrations of the parent drugs and CYP-specific 
      metabolites were quantified in plasma and urine using liquid chromatography with 
      tandem mass spectrometry. In plasma, the decreased metabolic area under the curve 
      (AUC) ratio, defined as the metabolite AUC to parent AUC, of omeprazole indicated 
      significant decreases of CYP2C19 (P = 0.002) enzymatic activities in NASH 
      adolescents, while the urine analyses did not show significant differences and 
      were highly variable. A comparison between the present in vivo pediatric studies 
      and a previous ex vivo study in adults indicates distinct differences in the 
      activities of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. These data demonstrate that pediatric NASH 
      presents an altered pattern of CYP activity and NASH should be considered as a 
      confounder of drug metabolism for certain CYP enzymes. These differences could 
      lead to future investigations that may reveal unexpected variable drug responses 
      that should be considered in pediatric dosage recommendations.

TI  - [EVALUATION OF THE PHARMACOKINETIC INTERACTION OF AFOBAZOLE WITH CYP2C9 ENZYME 
      DRUG SUBSTRATE OF CYTOCHROME P450].
PG  - 18-22
AB  - We have studied the pharmacokinetics of drug-marker of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 
      CYP2C9 (losartan) and its metabolite E-3174 after subchronic oral administration 
      of afobazole in doses 5 and 25 mg/kg in rats. The metabolic ratio (MR) of 
      E-3174/Losartan was calculated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan and 
      its metabolite on the background of 4-day afabazole administration 5 mg/kg dose 
      were not significantly different from analogous values calculated for the control 
      group of rats. Therefore, afobazole in the effective anxiolytic dose did not 
      change the MR value of metabolized P450 isoform. A five-fold dose increase in the 
      afobazole dose led to significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      including A UC0-t, Cmax, Kel, t1/2el, MRT, CL/F, and Vd/F of losartan and AUC0-T, 
      Cmax, and Tmax of E-3174. These findings are indicative of the induction of 
      CYP2C9 isoenzyme by afobazole.

TI  - Is it Possible to Differentiate between Angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) Receptor 
      Blockers in Normotensive Volunteers?

AB  - Variability of blood pressure responses to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin 
      system is influenced by factors inherent in the patient, such as renin status, 
      and by drug-specific factors, such as pharmacokinetics. The 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions of two doses of candesartan 
      cilexetil, which is an ester prodrug of the insurmountable angiotensin II type 1 
      (AT 1 ) receptor blocker candesartan, were compared with those of the standard 
      dose of losartan in normotensive volunteers whose renin status was controlled by 
      mild sodium depletion. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, the 
      effects of single oral doses of candesartan cilexetil, 8 mg and 16 mg, and 
      losartan, 50 mg, were compared for 24 h in 16 healthy individuals pretreated with 
      a single 40-mg dose of furosemide. Mean blood pressure was recorded by repeated 
      measurements using the oscillometric method. In addition, measurements were made 
      of plasma active renin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma levels of 
      candesartan and EXP-3174, the active metabolites of candesartan cilexetil and 
      losartan, respectively, were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography 
      and correlated to pharmacodynamic changes. The large interindividual variability 
      of EXP-3174 levels in subjects who received losartan revealed a significant 
      correlation between active renin and peak drug levels ( r = 0.77, n = 16, p < 
      0.01). Such a correlation was not found within either group of individuals who 
      received candesartan cilexetil, because of lower interindividual pharmacokinetic 
      variability. A dose-response relationship was found between plasma renin and 
      candesartan when both doses of candesartan cilexetil were analysed. The 
      pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral dose of candesartan cilexetil, 16 mg, 
      were superior to those of candesartan cilexetil, 8 mg, and losartan, 50 mg (see 
      Table). This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of a parallel-group, 
      dose-determination study performed in hypertensive patients. The less variable 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction for candesartan cilexetil than for 
      losartan could account for the smooth 24-h reduction in blood-pressure found in 
      patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. These results suggest not only that 
      AT 1 -receptor antagonists can be differentiated, but that they will not be 
      equally useful in clinical practice where, in contrast to clinical research, 
      clear evidence is more difficult to obtain because of variability in renin 
      status.

TI  - Additive effects of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and 
      angiotensin II antagonism on blood pressure and renin release in sodium-depleted 
      normotensives.
PG  - 825-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not decrease plasma 
      angiotensin (Ang) II levels 24 hours after drug intake to the same extent as at 
      peak. This intermittent partial "escape" is explained either by a renin-mediated 
      reactive rise in plasma Ang I or by non-ACE-dependent Ang II generation. We 
      therefore tested the hypothesis that a combination of ACE inhibition and Ang II 
      blockade may have additive biological and hemodynamic effects. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: In a single-dose, double-blind, randomized, four-way, crossover study, 
      an Ang II antagonist (losartan 50 mg), an ACE inhibitor (captopril 50 mg), their 
      combination, and matched placebos were orally administered to 12 normotensive 
      male volunteers maintained in mild sodium depletion. When captopril 50 mg and 
      losartan 50 mg were given alone, the magnitude of their effects on blood 
      pressure, plasma active renin, Ang I, and aldosterone was similar, whereas the 
      kinetics of their effects were different, reflecting differences in drug 
      pharmacokinetics. The losartan-captopril combination completely suppressed the 
      rise in plasma Ang II induced by losartan 2 hours after drug intake (3.3 +/- 3.6 
      pg/mL versus 20.3 +/- 19.1 pg/mL, respectively, P < .05). Six hours after drug 
      intake, the losartan-captopril combination induced a significantly greater 
      decrease in mean blood pressure than that produced by either losartan or 
      captopril alone (73 +/- 7 mm Hg versus 79 +/- 8 mm Hg versus 81 +/- 7 mm Hg, 
      respectively, P < .05). The maximum placebo-subtracted falls in mean blood 
      pressure for the losartan-captopril combination, captopril 50 mg, and losartan 50 
      mg were 14 +/- 5 mm Hg, 10 +/- 3 mm Hg, and 9 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively (F2.22 = 
      3.45, P < .05). The duration of the mean blood pressure fall was not prolonged by 
      the combination. After combined losartan-captopril administration, the area under 
      the plasma active renin versus time curve (0 to 24 hours) was significantly 
      increased when compared with either losartan or captopril alone (6404 +/- 2961 
      pg.h.mL-1 versus 3105 +/- 1461 pg.h.mL-1 versus 2092 +/- 867 pg.h.mL-1, 
      respectively, P < .05). The combination had no additive effects on plasma 
      aldosterone decrease when compared with either losartan or captopril alone (58 
      +/- 17% versus 51 +/- 20% versus 53 +/- 21%, respectively, NS). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      combined administration of a standard single oral dose of an ACE inhibitor and an 
      Ang II antagonist to mildly sodium-depleted normal subjects (1) had a major 
      additive effect on plasma renin rise, (2) induced an additional mean blood 
      pressure reduction, and (3) had no additive effect on plasma aldosterone fall.

TI  - Pre-treatment with curcumin enhances plasma concentrations of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - The study was carried out in the Wistar rats to investigate the effect of 
      curcumin pre-treatment on the pharmacokinetics of the hypertension-treating drug 
      losartan and its metabolite EXP3174 following single oral administration. In the 
      treatment group, rats were gavaged with losartan 10 mg/kg after repeat oral doses 
      of curcumin (100 mg/kg, for 7 d), while rats in the control group were 
      administrated only with the same dose losartan. The results showed that curcumin 
      significantly increased the plasma concentrations of losartan and its metabolite 
      EXP3174. The present study implicated the existence of herb-drug interaction 
      between curcumin and losartan, and further evaluation of the possible interaction 
      during curcumin administration needs to be considered.

      Method for Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of

      in Rats.

AB  - Recently, potent neuroprotective and anti-diabetic effects of 
      7β-(3-Ethyl-cis-crotonoyloxy)-1α-(2-methylbutyryloxy)-3,14-dehydro-Z-notonipetranone 
      (ECN), a sesquiterpenoid isolated from Tussilago farfara Linnaeus, have been 
      elucidated. To facilitate further pre-clinical evaluation in rats, an analytical 
      method for the determination of ECN in rat plasma was developed and optimized by 
      using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma samples 
      were pretreated by the protein precipitation method with an acetonitrile solution 
      of losartan (LST) as the internal standard. Chromatographic separation was 
      performed using a an Octadecyl-silica (ODS) column (2.6 µm, 100 x 4.6 mm) in the 
      isocratic mode. The mobile phase, comprising 10 mM ammonium formate in water pH 
      5.75) and acetonitrile (11:89, v/v), was eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. 
      Mass spectrometric detection was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring 
      mode with positive electrospray ionization, and the mass transitions of ECN and 
      LST were m/z 431.3 to 97.3 and m/z 423.1 to 207.2, respectively. The calibration 
      curves of spiked plasma samples were linear in the 10.0-10,000 ng/mL range (r(2) 
      > 0.996). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was determined as 10.0 ng/mL. 
      Validation was conducted in the LLOQ, and three quality control (QC) sample 
      levels (10.0, 25.0, 3750, and 7500 ng/mL) were studied. Among them, the relative 
      standard deviation for the within- and between-run precisions was under 9.90%, 
      and the relative error of the accuracies was within the -8.13% to 0.42% range. 
      The validated method was successfully employed to investigate the pharmacokinetic 
      properties of ECN in rats, which revealed the linear pharmacokinetic behavior of 
      ECN for the first time.

TI  - Clinical and hormonal effects of the new angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      LRB081.
PG  - 252-8
AB  - The renin-angiotensin system is a major contributor to the pathophysiology of 
      cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. 
      Antagonizing angiotensin (Ang) II at the receptor site may produce fewer side 
      effects than inhibition of the promiscuous converting enzyme. The present study 
      was designed to assess in healthy human subjects the effect of LRB081, a new 
      orally active AT1-receptor antagonist, on the pressor action of exogenous Ang II. 
      At the same time, plasma hormones and drug levels were monitored. At 1-week 
      intervals and in a double-blind randomized fashion, 8 male volunteers received 
      three doses of LRB081 (10, 40, and 80 mg) and placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was 
      measured at a finger by photoplethysmograph. The peak BP response to intravenous 
      injection of a standard dose of Ang II was determined before and for < or = 24 h 
      after administration of an oral dose of LRB081 or placebo. After drug 
      administration, the blood BP response to Ang II was expressed in percent of the 
      response before drug administration. At the same time, plasma renin activity 
      (PRA), Ang II, aldosterone, catecholamine (radioassays), and drug levels (by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography) were monitored. After LRB081 
      administration, a dose dependent inhibition of the BP response to Ang II was 
      observed. Maximal inhibition of the systolic BP response was 54 +/- 3 (mean +/- 
      SEM), 63 +/- 2, and 93 +/- 1% with 10, 40, and 80 mg LRB081, respectively. The 
      time to peak was 3 h for 6 subjects and 4 and 6 h for 2 others. Preliminary 
      plasma half-life (t1/2) was calculated at 2 h. With the highest dose, the 
      inhibition remained significant for 24 h (31 +/- 5%, p < 0.05). Maximal 
      BP-blocking effect and maximal plasma drug level coincided, suggesting that the 
      unmetabolized LRB081 is responsible for the antagonistic effect. PRA and Ang II 
      increased dose dependently after LRB081 intake. Aldosterone, epinephrine, and 
      norepinephrine concentrations remained unchanged. No clinically significant 
      adverse reaction was observed during the study. LRB081 is a well-tolerated, 
      orally active, potent, and long-acting Ang II receptor antagonist. Unlike in the 
      case of losartan, no active metabolite of LRB081 has been shown to be responsible 
      for the main effects.

TI  - Bioequivalence study of two different film-coated tablet formulations of 
      losartan-hydrochlorothiazide in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 369-75
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1296523 [doi]
AB  - The study was conducted in order to assess the bioequivalence of two film-coated 
      formulations containing 100 mg of losartan (CAS 124750-99-8) and 12.5 mg of 
      hydrochlorothiazide (CAS 58-93-5). Seventy-three healthy subjects were enrolled 
      in a randomised, single-dose, open-label, two-way crossover study, with a minimum 
      washout period of 7 days. A total of 21 blood samples were collected up to 36 h 
      post-dosing. Losartan, losartan carboxy acid and hydrochlorothiazide levels were 
      determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass detection (lower limit of 
      quantification: 1.01 ng/mL for hydrochlorothiazide, 2.02 ng/mL for losartan and 
      2.51 ng/mL for losartan carboxy acid). Pharmacokinetic parameters used for 
      bioequivalence assessment (AUC(0-t) and Cmax as primary and AUC(0-inf) as 
      secondary pharmacokinetic parameters) were determined from the losartan and 
      hydrochlorothiazide concentration data using non-compartmental analysis. Data 
      from losartan carboxy acid was reported and presented as supportive data. The 90% 
      confidence intervals (obtained by ANOVA) for losartan were 97.05-118.48% for Cmax 
      100.76-106.10% for AUC(0-t) and 100.80-106.10% for AUC(0-inf) whereas for 
      hydrochlorothiazide the 90% confidence intervals obtained were 103.94-115.33% for 
      Cmax, 101.97-109.61% for AUC(0-t) and 101.77-109.02% for AUC(0-inf), and for 
      losartan carboxy acid the intervals obtained were 98.31-107.82% for Cmax, 
      97.89-104.30% for AUC(0-t) and 98.06-104.30% for AUC(0-inf). All the 90% 
      confidence intervals obtained for all the parameters assessed were within the 
      predefined ranges (80-125%). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the 
      evaluated formulations are bioequivalent in terms of rate and extent of 
      absorption.

TI  - Multiplex Phenotyping for Systems Medicine: A One-Point Optimized Practical 
      Sampling Strategy for Simultaneous Estimation of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
      CYP2D6 Activities Using a Cocktail Approach.
PG  - 88-96
LID - 10.1089/omi.2015.0131 [doi]
AB  - Phenotyping of the CYP450 enzyme activities contributes to personalized medicine, 
      but the past phenotyping approaches have followed a piecemeal strategy measuring 
      single enzyme activities in vivo. A barrier to phenotyping of populations in 
      rural and remote areas is the limited time and resources for sample collection. 
      The CEIBA cocktail approach allows metabolic capacity estimation of multiple 
      CYP450 enzymes in a single sample analysis, but the attendant sample collection 
      schemes for applications in diverse global settings are yet to be optimized. The 
      present study aimed to select an optimal matrix to simultaneously analyze CYP450 
      enzyme activities so as to simplify the sampling schemes in the phenotyping 
      protocol to enhance its throughput and feasibility in native populations or in 
      remote and underserviced geographies and social contexts. We evaluated 13 
      Ecuadorian healthy volunteers for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genotypes 
      and their metabolic phenotypes, including CYP3A4, in plasma and urine after 
      administering one reduced dose of caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, and 
      dextromethorphan. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed, and the correlation 
      between AUC parent/AUC metabolite and the ratio between concentrations of probe 
      drugs and their corresponding metabolites at timepoints ranging from 0 to 12 
      hours post-dose were analyzed. A single sampling timepoint, 4 hours post-dose in 
      plasma, was identified as optimal to reflect the metabolic activity of the 
      attendant CYP450 enzymes. This study optimizes the CEIBA multiplexed phenotyping 
      approach and offers new ways forward for integrated drug metabolism analyses, in 
      the pursuit of global personalized medicine applications in resource-limited 
      regions, be they in developed or developing countries.

TI  - Effect of Red Ginseng on cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein activities in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 375-381
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the drug interaction profile of Red Ginseng (RG) with 
      respect to the activities of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and the drug 
      transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in healthy Korean volunteers. METHODS: This 
      article describes an open-label, crossover study. CYP probe cocktail drugs, 
      caffeine, losartan, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, midazolam, and fexofenadine 
      were administered before and after RG supplementation for 2 wk. Plasma samples 
      were collected, and tolerability was assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      calculated, and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of 
      the parameters were determined from logarithmically transformed data using 
      analysis of variance after RG administration versus before RG administration. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen healthy male participants were evaluated, none of whom were 
      genetically defined as poor CYP2C9, 2C19, and CYP2D6 metabolizers based on 
      genotyping. Before and after RG administration, the geometric least-square mean 
      metabolic ratio (90% CI) was 0.870 (0.805-0.940) for caffeine to paraxanthine 
      (CYP1A2), 0.871 (0.800-0.947) for losartan (CYP2C9) to EXP3174, 1.027 
      (0.938-1.123) for omeprazole (CYP2C19) to 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 1.373 
      (0.864-2.180) for dextromethorphan to dextrorphan (CYP2D6), and 0.824 
      (0.658-1.032) for midazolam (CYP3A4) to 1-hydroxymidazolam. The geometric mean 
      ratio of the area under the curve of the last sampling time (AUC(last)) for 
      fexofenadine (P-gp) was 0.963 (0.845-1.098). Administration of concentrated RG 
      for 2 wk weakly inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and weakly induced CYP2D6. However, 
      no clinically significant drug interactions were observed between RG and CYP and 
      P-gp probe substrates. CONCLUSION: RG has no relevant potential to cause CYP 
      enzyme- or P-gp-related interactions. Clinical trial registration number 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT02056743.

TI  - Drug concentration response relationships in normal volunteers after oral 
      administration of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
PG  - 513-21
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plasma 
      concentrations of losartan, an orally active angiotensin II inhibitor, its active 
      metabolite EXP3174, and angiotensin II blockade. Six healthy subjects received 
      single oral doses of 40, 80, or 120 mg losartan and placebo at 1-week intervals 
      in a crossover study. Angiotensin II blockade was assessed by the blood pressure 
      response to exogenous angiotensin II before and after losartan administration. 
      EXP3174 reached higher plasma concentrations and was eliminated more slowly than 
      its parent compound; its levels paralleled the profile of angiotensin II blockade 
      closer than losartan. Inhibition of the pressure response was dose dependent. The 
      Hill-shaped relationship between response and EXP3174 concentration (or 
      time-integrated variables) approached a plateau with 80 mg. The dose-dependent 
      increase in plasma renin and angiotensin II exhibited a considerable individual 
      scatter. We conclude that losartan produces a dose-dependent, effective 
      angiotensin II blockade that is largely determined by the active metabolite 
      EXP3174.

TI  - Frequency of CYP2C9 alleles in Koreans and their effects on losartan 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 1303-8
LID - 10.1038/aps.2011.100 [doi]
AB  - AIM: CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes numerous clinically important drugs. The aim of 
      this study is to investigate the frequencies of CYP2C9 genotypes and the effects 
      of selected alleles on losartan pharmacokinetics in a large sample of the Korean 
      population. METHODS: The CYP2C9 gene was genotyped in 1796 healthy Korean 
      subjects. CYP2C9 alleles (CYP2C9*1, *2, *3 and *13 alleles) were measured using 
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
      assay and direct sequencing assay. The enzymatic activity of each CYP2C9 genotype 
      was evaluated using losartan as the substrate. RESULTS: The frequencies of 
      CYP2C9*1, *3 and *13 allele were 0.952 (95% confidence interval 0.945-0.959), 
      0.044 (95% CI 0.037-0.051) and 0.005 (95% CI 0.003-0.007), respectively. The 
      frequencies of the CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*3, *1/*13 and *3/*3 genotypes were 0.904 (95% 
      CI 0.890-0.918), 0.085 (95% CI 0.072-0.098), 0.009 (95% CI 0.005-0.013) and 0.001 
      (95% CI 0.000-0.002), respectively. In the pharmacokinetics studies, the AUC(0-∞) 
      of losartan in CYP2C9*3/*3 subjects was 1.42-fold larger than that in CYP2C9*1/*1 
      subjects, and the AUC(0-∞) of E-3174, a more active metabolite of losartan, in 
      CYP2C9*3/*3 subjects was only 12% of that in CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. CONCLUSION: 
      The results confirmed the frequencies of CYP2C9 genotypes in a large cohort of 
      Koreans, and detected the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. CYP2C9*3/*3 subjects metabolized 
      much less losartan into E-3174 than CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects.

TI  - Study Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label, Prospective, and Observational Study to 
      Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Drugs Administered to Patients during 
      Extracorporeal Circulation; Potential of In Vivo Cytochrome P450 Phenotyping to 
      Optimise Pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Pharmacokinetic alterations of medications administered during surgeries 
      involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
      (ECMO) have been reported. The impact of CPB on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      enzymes' activity is the key factor. The metabolic rates of caffeine, 
      dextromethorphan, midazolam, omeprazole, and Losartan to the CYP-specific 
      metabolites are validated measures of in vivo CYP 1A2, 2D6, 3A4, 2C19, and 2C9 
      activities, respectively. The study aim is to assess the activities of major CYPs 
      in patients on extracorporeal circulation (EC). This is a pilot, prospective, 
      open-label, observational study in patients undergoing surgery using EC and 
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a control group. CYP 
      activities will be measured on the day, and 1-2 days pre-surgery/3-4 days 
      post-surgery (cardiac surgery and Laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and 1-2 days 
      after starting ECMO, 1-2 weeks after starting ECMO, and 1-2 days after 
      discontinuation from ECMO. Aforementioned CYP substrates will be administered to 
      the patient and blood samples will be collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-dose. 
      Major CYP enzymes' activities will be compared in each participant on the day, 
      and before/after surgery. The CYP activities will be compared in three study 
      groups to investigate the impact of CYPs on EC.

TI  - Prediction of the Area under the Curve Using Limited-Point Blood Sampling in a 
      Cocktail Study to Assess Multiple CYP Activities.
PG  - 762-770
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b20-00691 [doi]
AB  - A cocktail study is an in vivo evaluation method to assess multiple CYP 
      activities via a single trial and single administration of a cocktail drug that 
      is a combination of multiple CYP substrates. However, multiple blood samples are 
      required to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a CYP probe drug. A limited-point 
      sampling method is generally beneficial in clinical studies because of the 
      simplified protocol and reduced participant burden. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate whether a limited-point plasma concentration analysis of CYP substrates 
      in a cocktail drug could predict their area under the curve (AUC). We created 
      prediction models of five CYP substrates (caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, 
      dextromethorphan, and midazolam) using multiple linear regressions from the data 
      of two cocktail studies, and then performed predictability analysis of these 
      models using data derived from data in the co-administration with inducer 
      (rifampicin) and inhibitors (fluvoxamine and cimetidine). For the administration 
      of inhibitors, the AUC prediction accuracy (mean absolute error (MAE)) were 
      <39.5% in Model 1 and <26.2% in Model 2 which were created using 1- and 4-point 
      sampling data. MAE shows larger values in the administration of inducer in 
      compared with the administration of inhibitors. The accuracy of the prediction in 
      Model 2 could be acceptable for screening of inhibitions. MAE for caffeine, 
      dextromethorphan, and midazolam were acceptable in the model that used 4 sampling 
      points from all data. The use of this method could reduce the burden on the 
      subject and make it possible to evaluate each AUC in a minimally invasive manner.

TI  - Influence of compound danshen tablet on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
PG  - 1219-24
LID - 10.1002/bmc.2930 [doi]
AB  - Losartan is an effective anti-hypotension drug frequently used in clinic. 
      Compound danshen tablet (CDST) is an important traditional Chinese multiherbal 
      formula composed of Danshen, Sanqi and Bingpian, which is widely used for the 
      treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China. More often, 
      losartan and CDST are simultaneously used for the treatment of anti-hypertension 
      in the clinic. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan and EXP3174 after oral administration of single losartan and both 
      losartan and CDST, and to investigate the influence of CDST on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite EXP3174. Male Sprague-Dawley rats 
      were randomly assigned to two groups: a losartan-only group and a losartan and 
      CDST group. Plasma concentrations of losartan and EXP3174 were determined by 
      LC-MS at designated points after drug administration, and the main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. It was found that there were 
      significant differences (p < 0.05) between the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      losartan and EXP3174, which showed that CDST influenced the metabolism and 
      excretion of losartan in vivo. The result could be used for clinical medication 
      guidance of losartan and CDST to avoid the occurrence of adverse reactions.

TI  - Determination of plasma concentrations of losartan in patients by HPLC using 
      solid phase extraction and UV detection.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a HPLC assay for plasma losartan and its active metabolite 
      EXP3174 to facilitate clinical pharmacokinetic studies. METHODS: the HPLC system 
      consisted of a 250 x 2 mm i.d. C18 reversed phase column preceded by a 4 x 4 mm 
      guard column, a UV detector set at 254 nm, and an integrator. The mobile phase 
      was a mixture of 0.01 M ammonium phosphate: acetonitrile: methanol (6:3:1) 
      containing 0.02 % sodium azide and 0.04% TEA, with pH adjusted to 3.2. The system 
      was operated isocratically at ambient temperature at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. 
      Losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 were extracted from plasma using C2 
      bonded silica gel standard solid phase extraction. RESULTS: recoveries of 
      losartan and EXP3174 from plasma were greater than 70%. Using 0.5 ml of plasma 
      sample, standard curves were linear from 10 to 300 ng/ml (r2 = 0.996 and 0.997 
      for losartan and EXP 3174, respectively). Sensitivity of the assay was < 10 
      ng/ml. Intra-and inter-assay variations were < 10 and 15%. respectively. The 
      assay has been successfully applied to measuring plasma concentrations of 
      losartan and EXP3174 in patients receiving a daily dose of losartan (50-100 mg). 
      CONCLUSION: The HPLC assay has adequate sensitivity, reproducibility, and 
      specificity for clinical pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Two selective HPTLC methods for determination of some angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists in tablets and biological fluids.
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3916 [doi]
AB  - Two simple, selective, precise and highly sensitive high-performance thin-layer 
      chromatography (HPTLC) methods have been developed and validated for analysis of 
      five angiotensin II receptor antagonists, namely losartan, irbesartan valsartan, 
      candesartan and olmesartan, which are widely used in clinical practice. HPTLC of 
      the drugs was performed on pre-coated silica gel HPTLC plates 60 F(254) by 
      development using a mobile phase composed of chloroform-acetone-glacial acetic 
      acid (7.8:1.5:0.7m v/v/v), which was suitable for all of the studied drugs. The 
      first method depended on utilizing reflectance/fluorescence mode for detection 
      while the second method depended on using 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone as 
      spraying reagent for the first time to form orange spots scanned at 460 nm. A 
      good linear relationship was obtained over the concentration ranges of 1.2-60 and 
      360-3000 ng/band while detection and quantification limits were in the ranges of 
      0.07-0.43, 45.2-140.49 and 0.21-1.29, 137.05-425.74 ng/band for 
      reflectance/fluorescence and reflectance/absorbance methods respectively. The 
      developed methods were applied successfully for their determination in tablets

AB  - Combination of metolazone (0.5 mg) and valsartan (80 mg) has been verified as a 
      promising therapy treatment for hypertension. In order to facilitate to 
      pharmacokinetic research, it needs a method for the simultaneously determination 
      of metolazone and valsartan in biological samples. However, there are no relative 
      reports so far. In order to facilitate to pharmacokinetic research, an on-line 
      solid phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of metolazone and 
      valsartan in beagle dog plasma was developed and validated in this study. An 
      on-line solid phase extraction column Retain PEP Javelin (10 mm × 2.1 mm) was 
      used to remove impurities in plasma samples. The metolazone, valsartan and 
      internal standard (losartan) were separated on a Poroshell 120 SB-C18 column 
      (4.6 mm × 50 mm × 2.7 µm) with a gradient elution procedure. Acidified 
      acetonitrile/water mixture was used as a mobile phase. The selected 
      multiple-reaction monitoring mode in positive ion was performed and the parent to 
      the product transitions m/z 366/259, m/z 436.2/291 and m/z 423.4/207 were used to 
      measure the metolazone, valsartan and losartan. The method was linear over the 
      range of 0.1-100 ng/mL and 1-1000 ng/mL for metolazone and valsartan, 
      respectively. This method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, 
      sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, and stability and then 
      successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies of the metolazone and valsartan 
      combination tablets in beagle dogs.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of losartan, losartan acid and amlodipine in human 
      plasma by LC-MS/MS and its application to a human pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.4103/2229-4708.97711 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometric assay method has been developed and fully validated for 
      simultaneous quantification of losartan and its active metabolite, losartan 
      carboxylic acid, and amlodipine in human plasma. Irbesartan was used as an 
      internal standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analytes were extracted from human 
      plasma samples by solid-phase extraction technique using Oasis HLB cartridges, 
      (Waters Corporation, Mumbai, India). The reconstituted samples were 
      chromatographed on a C18 column by using an 85:15, v/v mixture of methanol and 
      0.1% v/v formic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. A detailed 
      validation of the method was performed as per the FDA guidelines. RESULTS: The 
      calibration curves obtained were linear (r ≥ 0.99) over the concentration range 
      of 0.5-1000 ng/mL for losartan and for its active metabolite losartan acid and 
      0.05-10.1 ng/mL for amlodipine. The results of the intra- and inter-day precision 
      and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. CONCLUSIONS: A run 
      time of 2.5 min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 plasma 
      samples per day. The proposed method was found to be applicable to clinical 
      studies.

AB  - Drug transporters and CYP enzymes are important sources of pharmacokinetics (PK) 
      variability in drug responses and can cause various pharmacological and 
      toxicological consequences, leading to either toxicity or an insufficient 
      pharmacological effect. In recent years, the cocktail approach was developed to 
      determine in vivo CYP and transporters activities, but these approaches are 
      somewhat limited. We described the development and validation of three sensitive 
      and specific LC-MS/MS assays for the determination of P-gp and major human CYP 
      isoenzyme activities following oral administration of a drug cocktail of 
      subtherapeutic doses (lower than 10 times) of caffeine (CAF), omeprazole (OME), 
      losartan (LOS), midazolam (MDZ), metoprolol (METO) and fexofenadine (FEX) in 
      healthy volunteers. The three validated methods were selective for all tested 
      analytes. No interference or matrix effect was observed for the mass transition 
      and retention times for all compounds monitored. Additionally, assays were linear 
      over a wide range, and limits of quantification varied between 0.01-5 ng/mL 
      plasma. The coefficients of variation obtained in the precision studies and the 
      inter- and intra-assay accuracies were less than 15%, guaranteeing the 
      reproducibility and repeatability of the results. All substrates and metabolites 
      were stable in plasma during freeze-thaw cycles. Three healthy volunteers were 
      selected based on genotyping for CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. One volunteer was 
      genotyped as an extensive metabolizer (EM) for all tested CYP isoforms, one 
      volunteer was genotyped as a poor metabolizer (PM) for the CYP2C9 isoform 
      (CYP2C9*3/*3), and one volunteer was genotyped as a PM for the CYP2D6 isoform 
      (CYP2D6*4/*4). The methods allowed the quantification of all analytes over the 
      entire sampling period (12 h) in all studied genotypes. Thus, the analytical 
      methods described here were sufficiently sensitive for use in low-dose 
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Converting enzyme determines plasma clearance of angiotensin-(1-7).
PG  - 496-502
AB  - We determined the mechanism accounting for the removal and metabolism of 
      angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in 21 anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive 
      (SHR), 18 age-matched normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD), and 36 mRen-2 transgenic 
      (TG+) rats. Animals of all 3 strains were provided with tap water or tap water 
      containing losartan, lisinopril, or a combination of lisinopril and losartan for 
      2 weeks. On the day of the experiment, Ang-(1-7) was infused for a period of 15 
      minutes at a rate of 278 nmol . kg-1 . min-1. After this time, samples of 
      arterial blood were collected rapidly at regular intervals for the assay of 
      plasma Ang-(1-7) levels by radioimmunoassay. Infusion of Ang-(1-7) had a minimal 
      effect on vehicle-treated SD rats but elicited a biphasic pressor/depressor 
      response in vehicle-treated SHR and TG+ rats. In lisinopril-treated rats, 
      Ang-(1-7) infusion increased blood pressure, whereas losartan treatment abolished 
      the pressor component of the response without altering the secondary fall in 
      arterial pressure. Combined treatment with lisinopril and losartan abolished the 
      cardiovascular response to Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. In vehicle-treated SD, SHR 
      and TG+ the half-life (t1/2) of Ang-(1-7) averaged 10+/-1, 10+/-1, and 9+/-1 
      seconds, respectively. Lisinopril alone or in combination with losartan produced 
      a statistically significant rise in the half-life of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains 
      of rats. Plasma clearance of Ang-(1-7) was significantly greater in the untreated 
      SD rats compared with either the SHR or TG+ rat. Lisinopril treatment was 
      associated with reduced clearance of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. Concurrent 
      experiments in pulmonary membranes from SD and SHR showed a statistically 
      significant inhibition of 125I-Ang-(1-7) metabolism in the presence of 
      lisinopril. These studies showed for the first time that the very short half-life 
      of Ang-(1-7) in the circulation is primarily accounted for peptide metabolism by 
      ACE. These findings suggest a novel role of ACE in the regulation of the 
      production and metabolism of the two primary active hormones of the renin 
      angiotensin system.

TI  - Rapid determination of losartan and losartan acid in human plasma by multiplexed 
      LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 3388-94
LID - 10.1002/jssc.200900287 [doi]
AB  - A rapid LC-MS/MS method has been developed and validated for the determination of 
      losartan (LOS) and its metabolite losartan acid (LA) (EXP-3174) in human plasma 
      using multiplexing technique (two HPLC units connected to one MS/MS). LOS and LA 
      were extracted from human plasma by SPE technique using Oasis HLB cartridge 
      without evaporation and reconstitution steps. Hydroflumethiazide (HFTZ) was used 
      as an internal standard (IS). The analytes were separated on Zorbax SB C-18 
      column. The mass transition [M-H] ions used for detection were m/z 421.0 --> 
      127.0 for LOS, m/z 435.0 --> 157.0 for LA, and m/z 330.0 --> 239.0 for HFTZ. The 
      proposed method was validated over the concentration range of 2.5-2000 ng/mL for 
      LOS and 5.0-3000 ng/mL for LA with correlation coefficient > or = 0.9993. The 
      overall recoveries for LOS, LA, and IS were 96.53, 99.86, and 94.16%, 
      respectively. Total MS run time was 2.0 min/sample. The validated method has been 
      successfully used to analyze human plasma samples for applications in 100 mg 
      fasted and fed pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin receptor subtype inhibitors on plasma angiotensin 
      clearance.
PG  - 853-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether angiotensin receptor subtypes play 
      a role in angiotensin clearance from plasma. Angiotensin metabolic clearance rate 
      was measured in rats by the constant infusion method. Increasing doses of 
      angiotensin II were infused for 15 minutes, and blood was sampled for angiotensin 
      II. The type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan decreased the apparent 
      metabolic clearance rate by > 50% at low-dose infusion, suggesting that type 1 
      angiotensin II receptors are involved in angiotensin II clearance from plasma. At 
      higher angiotensin infusion rates, the-metabolic clearance rate of angiotensin 
      was unaffected. To dissect the contribution of renin-generated angiotensin, 
      additional experiments were performed in nephrectomized rats. In anephric rats, 
      angiotensin clearance was unaffected by type 1 angiotensin II receptor 
      inhibition. In contrast, the type 2 angiotensin II receptor ligand PD123319 in 
      intact rats caused a > 50% increase in metabolic clearance rate of angiotensin at 
      higher infusion rates (P < .05). In anephric rats, the type 2 angiotensin II 
      receptor ligand alone or combined with type 1 receptor inhibition was without 
      effect on the metabolic clearance rate or the T1/2 for angiotensin disappearance. 
      These data argue against a role for type 1 or 2 angiotensin II receptors as 
      clearance receptors. Increased clearance of angiotensin by type 2 receptor 
      blockade in the presence but not the absence of kidneys suggests an alternative 
      renal mechanism by which selective type 2 ligands may alter angiotensin effects.

TI  - Bioequivalence study of two losartan tablet formulations with special emphasis on 
      cardiac safety.
PG  - 349-59
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the bioequivalence of Losartan Potassium Tablets 50 mg 
      manufactured by Micro Labs Ltd. India to Cozaar® Tablets 50 mg, manufactured by 
      Merck Sharp and Dohme Ltd., UK in normal healthy adult subjects under fasting 
      condition along with the comparative safety evaluation of both treatments. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro dissolution studies were carried out on 12 
      units each of test and reference products using the paddle method and dissolution 
      media like water, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid with pH 1.2, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and 
      pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. An open label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, 
      two-sequence, crossover bioequivalence study with a washout period of 7 days was 
      conducted in 60 healthy Indian male subjects. Serial blood samples were collected 
      after drug administration in each study period. Plasma concentrations of losartan 
      and losartan acid were determined using a validated LC-MS-MS method. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan and losartan acid were determined using a 
      non compartmental model. Occurrence of adverse events, change in systolic blood 
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and QT interval from the baseline 
      to 3.50 h post dose were studied and compared between the two treatments as 
      safety parameters. RESULTS: The in vitro study proved the essential similarity of 
      both the formulations as evident from the similarity factor of > 50% in all the 
      dissolution media. The ratios for geometric least square means and 90% confidence 
      intervals were within the acceptance criteria of 80% to 125% for log transformed 
      C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) for losartan. No statistically significant 
      difference between the two treatments was observed for either of the safety 
      parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The test product Losartan Potassium tablets 50 mg 
      manufactured by Micro Labs Limited, India was bioequivalent to Cozaar® tablets 50 
      mg, manufactured by Merck Sharp and Dohme Ltd., UK in terms of rate and extent of 
      absorption. Both treatments were well tolerated and had similar non significant 
      effect on the safety parameters.

TI  - Tamoxifen inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 activity in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 421-4
AB  - Tamoxifen has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin 
      and also to increase the plasma level of phenytoin, which are mainly metabolized 
      by CYP2C9. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of tamoxifen on 
      CYP2C9 activity in vivo in humans. Thirteen breast cancer patients who would 
      start tamoxifen following cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. A 
      single oral dose of 25 mg losartan was given to the patients 2 days before and 2 
      weeks after starting tamoxifen therapy. Losartan and E3174 in 8-hour urine 
      samples were measured by HPLC. Tamoxifen significantly increased the average 
      urinary losartan/E3174 ratio from 0.73 (CI 95% = 0.15 - 2.30) to 1.66 (CI 95% = 
      0.68 - 5.20), after 2 weeks of treatment (p = 0.002). Tamoxifen inhibited CYP2C9 
      activity in breast cancer patients within two weeks of its administration. The 
      inhibition of CYP2C9 activity may be a possible explanation for the drug-drug 
      interaction of tamoxifen with CYP2C9 substrates.

TI  - Amodiaquine, its desethylated metabolite, or both, inhibit the metabolism of 
      debrisoquine (CYP2D6) and losartan (CYP2C9) in vivo.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the extent of in vivo inhibition by the antimalarial drug 
      amodiaquine, its active metabolite N-desethylamodiaquine, or both, of the 
      metabolism of four probe drugs of the enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. 
      METHODS: Twelve healthy Swedish volunteers received a cocktail of four probe 
      drugs (debrisoquine, omeprazole, losartan and caffeine) to determine their 
      baseline metabolic capacities. After a washout period, they received a 600 mg 
      oral dose of amodiaquine hydrochloride; and 2-3 h later the cocktail was 
      administered again. One week after the intake of amodiaquine, the subjects 
      received the cocktail a third time. The levels of probe drugs and their 
      metabolites as well as amodiaquine and its metabolite were determined by HPLC. 
      RESULTS: Plasma levels of amodiaquine and N-desethylamodiaquine could be followed 
      in all subjects for 6 h and 28 days, respectively. Among the 12 subjects, a 
      3-fold variation in amodiaquine AUC and a 2-fold variation in 
      N-desethylamodiaquine AUC, were observed. The CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 activities of the 
      subjects were measured by debrisoquine and losartan phenotyping tests, 
      respectively. There were significant mean increases in debrisoquine metabolic 
      ratio (MR) between baseline and the second cocktail [MR(2 h)-MR(baseline) 1.426 
      (95% confidence interval 1.159, 1.755), P=0.002; ANOVA, Fisher LSD test] and in 
      mean losartan MR between baseline and the second cocktail [MR(2 h)-MR(baseline) 
      1.724 (95% confidence interval 1.076, 2.762), P=0.026; ANOVA, Fisher LSD test]. 
      The effects on CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 activities subsided within a week after intake 
      of amodiaquine as tested by the phenotyping cocktail. The changes in omeprazole 
      MRs and caffeine MRs were not statistically significant between any of the study 
      phases. CONCLUSION: A single dose of amodiaquine decreased CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 
      activities significantly compared to baseline values. Amodiaquine has the 
      potential to cause drug-drug interactions and should be further investigated in 
      malarial patients treated with drug combinations containing amodiaquine.

TI  - Administration of vitamin E and losartan as prophylaxes in cisplatin-induced 
      nephrotoxicity model in rats.
PG  - 410-7
LID - 10.5301/jn.5000018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II; CDDP) is used widely as 
      an antitumor drug in clinics, but is accompanied with renal toxicity. The present 
      study was designed to compare the effect of losartan and vitamin E as prophylaxes 
      against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided 
      into 5 groups: group 1 receiving losartan 10 mg/kg; group 2, vitamin E in almond 
      oil 1 g/kg; group 3, combination of group 1 and 2 regimens; group 4, almond oil; 
      and group 5, negative control group. All groups were treated for a 4-day period, 
      but at day 3, groups 1-4 received a single dose (6 mg/kg) of CDDP. The animals 
      were sacrificed 1 week after CDDP administration. RESULTS: Animals' weight did 
      not change significantly, but increasing blood urea nitrogen and malondialdehyde 
      levels were observed statistically in all CDDP-treated animals. No detectable 
      change was observed in nitrite level, but serum osmolality in groups 1, 2 and 4 
      was different from that for group 5 (p<0.05). Kidney damage scoring showed no 
      significant difference between group 2 and the negative control group (group 2: 
      1.0 ± 0.24; group 5: 0.40 ± 0.10; p>0.05) but a statistically significant 
      difference from the positive control group (p<0.05). The tubular damage score of 
      group 1 also was not statistically significantly different from that of the 
      negative control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although vitamin E or losartan as 
      prophylaxes demonstrated some protective effects, the combination of losartan and 
      vitamin E did not protect against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity, for unknown 
      reasons which may relate to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions.

TI  - Comparative study of taste disturbance by losartan and perindopril in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 1319-23
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the degree of taste disturbance by losartan, 
      an angiotensin II receptor blocker, with that of perindopril, an 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Perindopril erbumine (2 mg), losartan 
      potassium (25 mg), or vehicle was given to Japanese volunteers (n = 7) for 14 
      days in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover design with a 14-day 
      washout period. Gustometry by filter-paper test and electrogustometry were 
      performed before and at the end of each trial. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and 
      serum and salivary zinc concentrations were measured. One subject dropped out 
      because of a perindopril-induced dry cough, but no one claimed a taste 
      disturbance. Detection thresholds of 4 basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, and 
      bitter) by the paper-disc test and electrogustometry were significantly worsened, 
      and plasma renin activity was elevated by the drugs, whereas the deteriorating 
      effects of 2 drugs did not significantly differ. These drugs did not affect zinc 
      concentrations in plasma and saliva. It was concluded that losartan and 
      perindopril similarly alter taste sensitivity during repeated dosing of the 
      drugs.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of losartan, EXP-3174 and hydrochlorothiazide in 
      plasma via fully automated 96-well-format-based solid-phase extraction and liquid 
      chromatography-negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 593-601
AB  - An automated, sensitive and high-throughput liquid chromatographic/electrospray 
      tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed for the simultaneous 
      determination of losartan (LOS), its major circulating metabolite EXP-3174 and 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in human plasma. LOS and HCTZ coexist in the same drug 
      formulation, and this is the first method that enables the simultaneous 
      determination of both drugs along with the active metabolite of LOS. Since these 
      drugs have different physicochemical properties, the employment of a 
      liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) protocol was precluded. A fully automated 
      solid-phase extraction (SPE) protocol, based on 96-well format plates, was used 
      to isolate these compounds and furosemide (internal standard, IS) from plasma. 
      Washing and elution steps were amended accordingly in order to minimize any 
      matrix effect from components of the plasma without reducing the elution of the 
      molecules of interest. The compounds were eluted from a C18 column and detected 
      with an API 3000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer using negative electrospray 
      ionization and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The assay was linear over the 
      range 1.00-400 ng/mL for LOS and EXP-3174 and 0.500-200 ng/mL for HCTZ, 
      respectively, when 200 microl of plasma was used in the extraction. The overall 
      intra- and interassay variations were within acceptance limits. The analysis time 
      for each sample was 4 min, and more than 300 samples could be analyzed in one day 
      by running the system overnight. The assay was simple, highly sensitive, 
      selective, precise, fast, and it enables the reliable determination of LOS, 
      EXP-3174 and HCTZ in pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence studies after per os 
      administration of a single tablet containing both drugs.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.
PG  - 263-81
AB  - Fluvastatin, the first fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been 
      shown to reduce cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidaemia, to prevent 
      subsequent coronary events in patients with established coronary heart disease, 
      and to alter endothelial function and plaque stability in animal models. 
      Fluvastatin is relatively hydrophilic, compared with the semisynthetic HMG-CoA 
      reductase inhibitors, and, therefore, it is extensively absorbed from the 
      gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, it is nearly completely extracted and 
      metabolised in the liver to 2 hydroxylated metabolites and an N-desisopropyl 
      metabolite, which are excreted in the bile. Approximately 95% of a dose is 
      recovered in the faeces, with 60% of a dose recovered as the 3 metabolites. The 
      6-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl fluvastatin metabolites are exclusively generated by 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and do not accumulate in the blood. CYP2C9, CYP3A4, 
      CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 form the 5-hydroxy fluvastatin metabolite. Because of its 
      hydrophilic nature and extensive plasma protein binding, fluvastatin has a small 
      volume of distribution with minimal concentrations in extrahepatic tissues. The 
      pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin are not influenced by renal function, due to its 
      extensive metabolism and biliary excretion; limited data in patients with 
      cirrhosis suggest a 30% reduction in oral clearance. Age and gender do not appear 
      to affect the disposition of fluvastatin. CYP3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin, 
      ketoconazole and itraconazole) have no effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, in 
      contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are primarily metabolised by 
      CYP3A and are subject to potential drug interactions with CYP3A inhibitors. 
      Coadministration of fluvastatin with gastrointestinal agents such as 
      cholestyramine, and gastric acid regulating agents (H2 receptor antagonists and 
      proton pump inhibitors), significantly alters fluvastatin disposition by 
      decreasing and increasing bioavailability, respectively. The nonspecific CYP 
      inducer rifampicin (rifampin) significantly increases fluvastatin oral clearance. 
      In addition to being a CYP2C9 substrate, fluvastatin demonstrates inhibitory 
      effects on this isoenzyme in vitro and in vivo. In human liver microsomes, 
      fluvastatin significantly inhibits the hydroxylation of 2 CYP2C9 substrates, 
      tolbutamide and diclofenac. The oral clearances of the CYP2C9 substrates 
      diclofenac, tolbutamide, glibenclamide (glyburide) and losartan are reduced by 15 
      to 25% when coadministered with fluvastatin. These alterations have not been 
      shown to be clinically significant. There are inadequate data evaluating the 
      potential interaction of fluvastatin with warfarin and phenytoin, 2 CYP2C9 
      substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and caution is recommended when using 
      fluvastatin with these agents. Fluvastatin does not appear to have a significant 
      effect on other CYP isoenzymes or P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.

TI  - Liquid chromatographic determination of irbesartan in human plasma.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - A simple and sensitive method was developed for determination of irbesartan by 
      liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Irbesartan and losartan (I.S.) 
      in human plasma were extracted using diethyl ether:dichloromethane (7:3, v/v) 
      followed by back extraction with 0.05 M sodium hydroxide. Neutralized samples 
      were analyzed using 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (containing 
      0.07% triethylamine as peak modifier, pH was adjusted with orthophosphoric acid 
      to pH 3.0) and acetonitrile (66:34, v/v). Chromatographic separation was achieved 
      on an ODS-C-18 column (100 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., particle size 5 microm) using 
      isocratic elution (at flow rate 1.25 ml/min). The peak was detected using a 
      fluorescence detector set at Ex 259 nm and Em 385 nm, and the total time for a 
      chromatographic separation was approximately 13 min. The validated quantitation 
      ranges of this method were 15-4000 ng/ml with coefficients of variation between 
      0.75 and 12.53%. Mean recoveries were 73.3-77.1% with coefficients of variation 
      of 3.7-6.3%. The between- and within-batch precision were 0.4-2.2% and 0.9-6.2%, 
      respectively. The between- and within-batch relative errors (bias) were (-5.5) to 
      0.9% and (-0.6) to 6.9%, respectively. Stability of irbesartan in plasma was 
      >89%, with no evidence of degradation during sample processing and 60 days 
      storage in a deep freezer at -70 degrees C. This validated method is sensitive 
      and simple with between-batch precision of <3% and can be used for 
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - High-sensitivity liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the 
      simultaneous determination of five drugs and their cytochrome P450-specific probe 
      metabolites in human plasma.
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.03.014 [doi]
AB  - A sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method 
      with electrospray ionization was developed for the simultaneous quantitation of 
      five probe drugs and their metabolites in human plasma for assessing the in vivo 
      activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP). CYP isoform specific substrates and their 
      metabolites of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (losartan), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 
      (dextromethorphan) and CYP3A (midazolam) were all simultaneously analyzed using 
      LC-MS/MS after administration of a mixture of five drugs (i.e., a "cocktail 
      approach") to healthy volunteers. The assay uses propranolol as an internal 
      standard; dual liquid extraction; a Xbridge MS C(18) (100 mm × 2.1mm, 3.5 μm) 
      column; a gradient mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile (7/3→3/7); mass 
      spectrometric detection in positive ion mode. The method was validated from 5 to 
      500 ng/mL for caffeine and paraxanthine, 0.1-40 ng/mL for losartan and EXP3174, 
      0.05-20 ng/mL for omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 0.008-0.8 ng/mL for 
      dextromethorphan and dextrorphan, 0.01-1.0 ng/mL for midazolam, and 0.04-4 ng/mL 
      for 1'-hydroxymidazolam. The intra- and inter-day precision over the 
      concentration ranges for all analytes were lower than 12.5% and 13.8% (relative 
      standard deviation, %RSD), and accuracy was between 86.5% and 108.4% and between 
      87.0% and 107.0%, respectively. This highly sensitive and quantitative method 
      allowed a pharmacokinetic study in subjects receiving doses 10-100 times lower 
      than typical therapeutic doses.

TI  - A Cocktail Interaction Study Evaluating the Drug-Drug Interaction Potential of 
      the Perpetrator Drug ASP8477 at Multiple Ascending Dose Levels.
PG  - 529-540
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.660 [doi]
AB  - ASP8477 (molecular weight 325.36 g/mol) is a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor 
      intended for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Results from in vitro studies 
      indicated that ASP8477 is a direct inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, 2C9, 
      2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes at expected efficacious concentrations, with the 
      strongest effect on CYP2C19; a phase 1 study confirmed ASP8477 to be a CYP2C19 
      inhibitor. To further evaluate the interaction potential of ASP8477, a cocktail 
      interaction study was performed using the probe substrates of the validated Inje 
      cocktail containing losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan 
      (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4). Because ASP8477 shows nonlinear 
      pharmacokinetics, 3 doses (20, 60, and 100 mg) were evaluated. This study 
      revealed changes in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) of the 
      probe substrates after treatment with 20, 60, and 100 mg ASP8477, respectively, 
      compared with substrates alone with geometric mean ratios of: midazolam, 119%, 
      151%, and 158%; losartan, 107%, 144%, and 190%; omeprazole, 213%, 456%, and 610%; 
      and dextromethorphan, 138%, 340%, and 555% (with increasing doses, respectively). 
      Overall, ASP8477 was a weak inhibitor for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, a moderate to strong 
      inhibitor for CYP2C19, and a weak to strong inhibitor for CYP2D6, with doses from 
      20 to 100 mg. This study confirmed that the Inje cocktail approach was able to 
      detect relevant drug-drug interactions impacting further development of ASP8477 
      and future therapeutic use. With the approach used here, the inhibiting effect of 
      a perpetrator drug on different CYP enzymes can be evaluated, and at different 
      doses, thereby supporting dose recommendations for potential interactions.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of DALI-LDL-apheresis in two patients treated with the 
      angiotensin II-receptor 1 antagonist losartan.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - Direct adsorption of lipids (DALI) is the first low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL)-apheresis technique capable of adsorbing LDL and lipoprotein (a) directly 
      from whole blood. The adsorber consists of negatively charged polyacrylate 
      ligands linked to a Eupergit matrix. Negatively charged ligands give rise to 
      activation of bradykinin, which is rapidly degraded by the angiotensin converting 
      enzyme (ACE). Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are contraindicated 
      in DALI-LDL-apheresis. This is the first paper to describe the efficacy and 
      safety of DALI-LDL-apheresis in patients treated with 50 mg of the angiotensin 
      II-receptor 1 antagonist (ARA) losartan. Two hypercholesterolemic patients were 
      treated for 79 patient months with weekly or biweekly DALI sessions (N = 221 
      sessions). Approximately 1.4 patient blood volumes were treated per session. 
      Acute reductions of LDL-cholesterol (63%) and lipoprotein (a) (62%) exceeded 60% 
      and laboratory safety parameters remained in the apheresis typical range. Mean 
      bradykinin plasma levels peaked in the efferent line post-adsorber at 1000 mL of 
      treated blood volume; 467 fmol/mL (N = 6 sessions) in the ARA-treated patients 
      and 671 fmol/mL (N = 9 sessions) in a control group of three DALI patients 
      without ARA medication (P = 0.69, n.s.). Clinically, the DALI sessions for the 
      ARA-treated patients were completely uneventful and blood pressure was not 
      significantly different in the two groups. In summary, according to this 
      retrospective pilot study, DALI-LDL-apheresis was shown for the first time to be 
      safe and effective in patients on ARA medication.

TI  - Cyclosporine-drug interactions and the influence of patient age.
PG  - 1579-84
AB  - Cyclosporine-drug interactions in adult transplant patients and the impact of age 
      were studied. The medical records of transplant patients receiving cyclosporine 
      therapy were identified. Data on patient demographics, cyclosporine dosages, 
      dosage form, blood trough concentrations, clinical laboratory test values, and 
      concurrent medications were collected. One-compartment models for oral and i.v. 
      administration were used to fit cyclosporine concentration data to population 
      pharmacokinetic and statistical models. Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM) 
      software was used. The influence of covariates, including but not limited to 
      concomitant medications and age, on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics was evaluated. 
      The records of 100 patients (36 women and 64 men) were reviewed. A mean +/- S.D. 
      of 9 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 1 medications per day were consumed by patients < 60 and > 
      or = 60 years old, respectively. Mean population pharmacokinetic values of 0.407 
      L/hr/kg for clearance, 4.0 L/kg for volume of distribution, 31% for 
      bioavailability, and 10.6 hours for half-life were determined on the basis of 569 
      blood cyclosporine levels. Twelve medications (sertraline, losartan, valsartan, 
      quinine, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, alendronate, 
      digoxin, acyclovir, and oxycodone) with previously unconfirmed pharmacokinetic 
      interactions with cyclosporine were identified as interacting. There was no 
      correlation between age and interactions. Patients taking cyclosporine were at 
      risk for pharmacokinetic drug interactions when cyclosporine was used in 
      combination with sertraline, losartan, valsartan, quinine, atorvastatin, 
      simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, alendronate, digoxin, acyclovir, and 
      oxycodone. Transplant patients 60-75 years of age had cyclosporine-drug 
      interactions similar to those in younger patients.

      various pharmacological activities. This study aims to evaluate its in vitro and 
      in vivo inhibitory potential against the nine major CYP enzymes. Of the nine 
      tested CYPs, it exerted the strongest inhibitory effect on CYP2C9-mediated 
      tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation with the lowest IC(50) (K(i)) value of 0.966 ± 0.149 
      μM (0.503 ± 0.0383 μM), in a competitive manner. Additionally, it strongly 
      inhibited other CYP2C9-catalyzed diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and losartan 
      oxidation activities. Upon 30 min pre-incubation of human liver microsomes with 
      SPN in the presence of NADPH, no obvious shift in IC(50) was observed, suggesting 
      that SPN is not a time-dependent inactivator of the nine CYPs. However, oral 
      co-administration of SPN had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
      diclofenac and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac in rats. Overall, SPN is a potent inhibitor 
      of CYP2C9 in vitro but not in vivo. The very low permeability of SPN in Caco-2 
      cells (P(app) value of 0.115 × 10(-6) cm/s), which suggests poor absorption in 
      vivo, and its high degree of plasma protein binding (>99.9%) may lead to the lack 
      of in vitro-in vivo correlation. These findings will be helpful for the safe and 
      effective clinical use of SPN.

AB  - Sustained release (SR) tablets containing solid dispersions (SD) granules of a 
      poorly water-soluble drug were prepared to investigate the controlled 
      pH-independent release of the drug. Losartan potassium (LST), an 
      anti-hypertensive agent was chosen as a model drug because of its pH-dependent 
      solubility and short elimination half-life. Poloxamer 188 was used as an SD 
      carrier. A free-flowing SD granule was prepared by adsorbing the melt of the drug 
      and poloxamer 188 onto the surface of an adsorbent, Aerosil 300 (fumed silicon 
      dioxide), followed by direct compression with polyethylene oxide (PEO, 5 × 10(6)) 
      to obtain an SD-loaded SR (SD-SR) matrix tablet. Differential scanning 
      calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed partially 
      amorphous structures of the drug in the SD granules. Scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images indicated adsorption 
      of SD granules onto the surface of the adsorbent. The SD granules dissolved 
      completely within 10 min, a dissolution rate much higher than that of pure LST. 
      Moreover, pH-independent sustained release of LST from the SD-SR tablet was 
      achieved for 2h in gastric fluid (pH 1.2) and for 10h in intestinal fluid (pH 
      6.8). A combination of SD techniques using surface adsorption and SR concepts is 
      a promising approach to control the release rate of poorly water-soluble drugs in 
      a pH-independent manner.

AB  - Inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and disposition is common in both 
      preclinical and clinical researches. Losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 
      present a high degree of inter-individual differences in blood concentrations 
      that affect drug efficacy and side effect. Pharmacometabolomics has been 
      increasingly applied on predicting the drug responses by analyzing the 
      differences in metabolic profile. A pre-dose metabolic phenotype was investigated 
      to interpret inter-individual variations in the metabolism characteristics of 
      losartan. (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic 
      profiles were performed on 36 healthy Chinese male volunteers by measuring their 
      pre-dose plasma samples. After oral administration of losartan, the 
      concentrations of losartan and its bioactive metabolite EXP3174 were monitored by 
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Orthogonal partial least-squares 
      (O-PLS) model was conducted to select potential biomarkers that substantially 
      contributed to the inter-individual variations in the metabolism features via 
      analyzing the ratio of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of its metabolite to 
      parent drug. Potential metabolites such as glycine, phosphorylcholine, choline, 
      creatine, creatinine, lactate, citrate, α-glucose, and lipids showed strong 
      correlations with metabolism features of losartan. In addition, the pathway 
      analysis revealed that baseline lipid metabolism, the glycine, serine and 
      threonine pathway, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis metabolism pathway were 
      significantly associated with the ratio of PK parameters of EXP3174 to losartan. 
      Step-wise multiple linear regression (MLR) was constructed to investigate the 
      potential roles of the selected biomarkers in predicting individualized 
      metabolism characteristics of losartan. These results showed that the pre-dose 
      individual metabolic traits may be a useful approach for characterizing 
      individual differences in losartan metabolism characteristics and therefore for 
      expediting personalized dose-setting in further clinical studies.

PG  - 130-9
AB  - Over the past 4 years, six angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) were 
      approved for treating essential hypertension. They differ with respect to dosing, 
      metabolism, elimination, clinical efficacy, and investigational applications. 
      Candesartan cilexetil is the only prodrug among the agents. Losartan is 
      distinguished from other ARBs by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated 
      biotransformation to its active metabolite EXP-3174. No ARB requires dosage 
      adjustment for renal impairment, but the initial dose of losartan should be 
      reduced 50% in hepatically impaired patients. None of the drugs is significantly 
      cleared by hemodialysis. Completion of continuing trials will elucidate the 
      drugs' role in treating heart failure, cerebral stroke, and myocardial 
      infarction.

TI  - A rapid HPLC method for the determination of losartan in human plasma using a

PG  - 569-72
AB  - A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using a 
      monolithic column has been developed for quantification of losartan (CAS 
      12450-98-8) in plasma. The assay enables the measurement of losartan for 
      therapeutic drug monitoring. The method involves a simple, one-step extraction 
      procedure. The analytical recovery was complete. The separation was carried out 
      in reversed-phase conditions using a Chromolith Performance (RP-18e, 100 x 4.6 
      mm) column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 0.01 mol/L disodium 
      hydrogen phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (60:40 v/v) adjusted to pH 3.5. The 
      wavelength was set at 254 nm. Thioridazine (CAS 50-52-2) was used as internal 
      standard. Losartan, thioridazine and the EXP 3174, the active metabolite of 
      losartan, appeared 3.4, 5.0 and 10.5 min post injection, respectively. The 
      calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 5-300 ng mL(-1) with a 
      minimum detectable limit of 2 ng mL(-1). The coefficients of variation for the 
      inter-day and intra-day assay were found to be less than 8 %. The applicability 
      of this method for pharmacokinetic studies in humans was demonstrated. The 
      present assay is rapid, simple, precise, and accurate and is suitable for 
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Role of AT1 and AT2 receptors in the plasma clearance of angiotensin II.
PG  - 464-9
AB  - This study assessed the role of angiotensin (Ang) AT1 and AT2 receptors as 
      modulators of the plasma clearance of Ang II. Groups of male spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats (SHRs; n = 25) were given an intravenous injection of either 
      saline, losartan, PD123319, losartan in combination with PD123319, or 
      Sar1-Thr8-Ang II. One hour later, Ang II (0.5 microg/kg) was infused for 15 min 
      into a vein. Immediately thereafter, arterial blood samples were collected at 
      regular intervals for the assay of plasma Ang II levels by radioimmunoassay. The 
      infusion of Ang II significantly increased baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
      in rats pretreated with either saline or PD123319 but not in those receiving 
      losartan, losartan combined with PD123319, or Sar1-Thr8-Ang II. The plasma 
      clearance of Ang II was significantly greater in rats injected with either 
      PD123319, losartan combined with PD123319, or Sar1-Thr8-Ang II compared to those 
      injected either saline or losartan. Furthermore, the half-life of Ang II in rats 
      pretreated with saline or losartan was significantly greater than that measured 
      in the other three groups. These results suggest that plasma clearance of Ang II 
      in the SHRs is independent of an AT1 receptor, but plasma levels of the peptide 
      are unexpectedly protected by an AT2 receptor-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Pulmonary absorption rate and bioavailability of drugs in vivo in rats: 
      structure-absorption relationships and physicochemical profiling of inhaled 
      drugs.
PG  - 1216-33
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to analyze the structure-absorption 
      relationships for pulmonary delivered drugs. First, the inhaled drugs on the 
      market during 2001 were identified and a profile of the calculated 
      physicochemical properties was made. Second, an in vivo pharmacokinetic 
      investigation was performed in anesthetized rats. Eight selected drugs were 
      administered by intratracheal nebulization and intravenous bolus administration 
      and the plasma concentrations of the drugs were determined by LC-MS-MS. Third, an 
      evaluation of the relationships between the absorption/bioavailability data and 
      the drugs' physicochemical characteristics and the epithelial permeability in 
      Caco-2 cells, respectively, was performed. The drug absorption rate was found to 
      correlate to the molecular polar surface area and the hydrogen bonding potential, 
      as well as to the apparent permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers, which 
      indicated that passive diffusion was the predominating mechanism of absorption in 
      the rat lung. In contrast to the intestinal mucosa and the blood-brain barrier, 
      the pulmonary epithelium was shown to be highly permeable to compounds with high 
      molecular polar surface area (e.g., PSA 479 A(2)). Furthermore, a high 
      bioavailability was found for the efflux transporter substrates talinolol (81%) 
      and losartan (92%), which provides functional evidence for a quantitatively less 
      important role for efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein, in limiting the 
      absorption of these drugs from the rat lung. In conclusion, the pulmonary route 
      should be regarded as a potential alternative for the delivery of drugs that are 
      inadequately absorbed after oral administration.

TI  - The basel cocktail for simultaneous phenotyping of human cytochrome P450 isoforms 
      in plasma, saliva and dried blood spots.
PG  - 271-282
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0115-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Phenotyping cocktails use a combination of cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP)-specific probe drugs to simultaneously assess the activity of 
      different CYP isoforms. To improve the clinical applicability of CYP phenotyping, 
      the main objectives of this study were to develop a new cocktail based on probe 
      drugs that are widely used in clinical practice and to test whether alternative 
      sampling methods such as collection of dried blood spots (DBS) or saliva could be 
      used to simplify the sampling process. METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 
      a new combination of commercially available probe drugs (the Basel cocktail) was 
      tested for simultaneous phenotyping of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 
      and CYP3A4. Sixteen subjects received low doses of caffeine, efavirenz, losartan, 
      omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in different combinations. All subjects were 
      genotyped, and full pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs and their main 
      metabolites were determined in plasma, dried blood spots and saliva samples. 
      RESULTS: The Basel cocktail was well tolerated, and bioequivalence tests showed 
      no evidence of mutual interactions between the probe drugs. In plasma, single 
      timepoint metabolic ratios at 2 h (for CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) or at 8 h (for the 
      other isoforms) after dosing showed high correlations with corresponding area 
      under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios (AUC0-24h parent/AUC0-24h 
      metabolite) and are proposed as simple phenotyping metrics. Metabolic ratios in 
      dried blood spots (for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19) or in saliva samples (for CYP1A2) were 
      comparable to plasma ratios and offer the option of minimally invasive or 
      non-invasive phenotyping of these isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: This new combination of 
      phenotyping probe drugs can be used without mutual interactions. The proposed 
      sampling timepoints have the potential to facilitate clinical application of 
      phenotyping but require further validation in conditions of altered CYP activity. 
      The use of DBS or saliva samples seems feasible for phenotyping of the selected 
      CYP isoforms.

TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a new series of potent AT1 
      selective angiotensin II receptor antagonists: 5-(biphenyl-4-ylmethyl)pyrazoles.
PG  - 547-58
AB  - The synthesis and pharmacological activity of a new series of 
      5-(biphenyl-4-ylmethyl)pyrazoles as potent angiotensin II antagonists both in 
      vitro (binding of [3H]AII) and in vivo (iv, inhibition of AII-induced increase in 
      blood pressure, pithed rats; po, furosemide-treated sodium-depleted rats) are 
      reported. The various substituents of the pyrazole ring have been modified taking 
      into account the receptor's requirements derived from related structure-activity 
      relationship studies. A propyl or butyl group at position 1 as well as a 
      carboxylic acid group at position 4 were shown to be essential for high affinity. 
      Different groups at position 3 (H, small alkyl, phenyl, benzyl) provided good 
      binding affinity, but oral activity was highly discriminating: bulky alkyl groups 
      provided the highest potencies. Among the acidic isosteres tested in the biphenyl 
      moiety, the tetrazole group proved to be the best. Compound 14n 
      (3-tert-butyl-1-propyl-5-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-y l] 
      methyl]-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, UR-7280) shows high potency both in vitro 
      (IC50 = 3 nM) and in vivo (iv, 61.2 +/- 10% decrease in blood pressure at 0.3 
      mg/kg; po, 30 mmHg fall in blood pressure at 0.3 mg/kg), in comparison to 
      losartan (IC50 = 59 nM; iv, 62.5 +/- 8.9% decrease in blood pressure at 1 mg/kg; 
      po, 13 mmHg fall in blood pressure at 3 mg/kg). These data, together with the 
      good pharmacokinetic profile of 14n in different species, have led to its 
      selection for clinical evaluation as an antihypertensive agent.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic approach to losartan in Marfan patients: a starting point to 
      improve dosing regimen?
PG  - 157-63
LID - 10.1515/dmpt-2016-0006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is under evaluation for managing Marfan patients with aortic 
      root dilatation. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes convert losartan to E3174 active 
      metabolite. The aim of this study is to describe the distribution of CYP2C9*2, 
      CYP2C9*3, CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 defective alleles, according to losartan 
      tolerance in paediatric Marfan patients. METHODS: We genotyped 53 paediatric 
      Marfan patients treated with losartan. The rate of aortic root dilatation was 
      evaluated using the delta z-score variation. Differences in tolerated losartan 
      daily doses with respect to CYP metabolic classes were assessed through the 
      Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The losartan daily dose spans from 0.16 to 2.50 
      mg/kg (median 1.10 mg/kg). As we expect from the pharmacokinetics pathway, we 
      observe highest tolerated dose in CYP2C9 poor metabolisers (median 1.50 mg/kg, 
      interquartile range 1.08-1.67 mg/kg); however, this difference is not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal dose of angiotensin receptor 
      blocker is not known, and no data are available about losartan pharmacogenetic 
      profile in Marfan syndrome; we have proposed a strategy to tackle this issue 
      based on evaluating the major genetic polymorphisms involved in the losartan 
      conversion into active carboxylic acid metabolite. Further studies are needed to 
      support the use of genetic polymorphisms as predictors of the right dose of 
      losartan.

      debrisoquine [cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6)] or mephenytoin [cytochrome P450 2C19 
      (CYP2C19)]. RESULTS: The areas under the curve (AUCinfinity) of losartan and 
      E-3174 did not differ between poor and extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine or 
      mephenytoin, respectively. CONCLUSION: About 14% of the antihypertensive drug 
      losartan is metabolized to the active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174, which 
      contributes to the effect of losartan. The present study suggests that CYP2D6 and 
      CYP2C19 are not involved to any major extent in the in vivo conversion of 
      losartan to E-3174.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of valproic acid on cytochrome P450 2C9 activity in epilepsy 
      patients.
PG  - 383-6
AB  - Drug interactions constitute a major problem in the treatment of epilepsy because 
      drug combinations are so common. Valproic acid is a widely used anticonvulsant 
      drug with a broad therapeutic spectrum. Case reports suggest interaction between 
      valproic acid and other drugs metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 isoforms. The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of valproic acid on 
      cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity by using losartan oxidation as a probe in 
      epilepsy patients. Patients were prescribed sodium valproate (mean 200 mg/day for 
      the first week and 400 mg/day in the following period) according to their 
      clinical need. A single oral dose of 25 mg losartan was given to patients before 
      and after the first dose, first week and 4 weeks of valproic acid treatment. 
      Losartan and E3174, the CYP2C9-derived carboxylic acid metabolite of losartan in 
      8 hr urine were assayed by using high pressure liquid chromatography. Urinary 
      losartan/E3174 ratio did not change significantly on the first day (0.9, 0.3-3.5; 
      median, range), and first week (0.6, 0.2-3.8; median, range), while a significant 
      increase was observed after 4 weeks of valproic acid treatment (1.1, 0.3-5.7; 
      median, range) as compared to that of measured before valproic acid 
      administration (0.6, 0.1-2.1; median, range) (P = 0.039). The degree of 
      inhibition was correlated with the steady-state plasma concentrations of valproic 
      acid (r(2) = 0.70, P = 0.04). The results suggest an inhibitory effect of 
      valproic acid on CYP2C9 enzyme activity in epilepsy patients at steady state. The 
      risk of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions should be taken into account 
      during concomitant use of valproic acid and CYP2C9 substrates.

TI  - Effects of Cytochrome P450 Inhibition and Induction on the Phenotyping Metrics of 
      the Basel Cocktail: A Randomized Crossover Study.
PG  - 79-91
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0294-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Activity of human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) shows 
      high inter-and intra-individual variability, which is determined by genetic and 
      non-genetic factors. Using a combination of CYP-specific probe drugs, phenotyping 
      cocktails allow simultaneous assessment of the activity of different CYP 
      isoforms. The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotyping metrics 
      of the Basel cocktail in healthy male subjects with induced and inhibited CYP 
      activity. METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, the probe drugs for 
      simultaneous phenotyping of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2B6 (efavirenz), CYP2C9 
      (losartan), 2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A4 (midazolam) were 
      administered to 16 subjects without pretreatment (baseline), after pretreatment 
      with a combination of CYP inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, ketoconazole, and 
      paroxetine), and after CYP induction with rifampicin. All subjects were 
      genotyped. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs and their main metabolites 
      and metabolic ratios 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after probe drug application were 
      determined in plasma and compared with the corresponding area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios. RESULTS: The Basel phenotyping cocktail 
      was well tolerated by all subjects independent of pretreatment. Good correlations 
      of metabolic ratios with AUC ratios of the corresponding probe drugs and their 
      metabolites for all three conditions (baseline, CYP inhibition, and CYP 
      induction) were found at 2 h after probe drug administration for CYP3A4, at 4 h 
      for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, and at 6 h for CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. While CYP inhibition 
      significantly changed AUC ratios and metabolic ratios at these time points for 
      all six CYP isoforms, CYP induction did not significantly change AUC ratios for 
      CYP2C9. For CYP3A4, total 1'-hydroxymidazolam concentrations after pretreatment 
      of samples with β-glucuronidase were needed to obtain adequate reflection of CYP 
      induction by the metabolic ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of CYP activity can be 
      detected with the Basel phenotyping cocktail for all six tested CYP isoforms at 
      the proposed time points. The AUC ratio of losartan:losartan carboxylic acid in 
      plasma does not seem suitable to detect induction of CYP2C9. The observed 
      metabolic ratios for inhibited and induced CYP activity need to be confirmed for 
      extensive metabolizers, and typical ratios for subjects with genetically altered 
      CYP activity will need to be established in subsequent studies.

TI  - The effect of tripterygium glucoside tablet on pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      its metabolite EXP3174 in rats.
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3973 [doi]
AB  - Losartan and tripterygium glucoside tablet (TGT) are often simultaneously used 
      for reducing urine protein excretion in clinic. However, it is unknown whether 
      there is potential herb-drug interaction between losartan and TGT. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate their potential herb-drug interaction, and clarify 
      the mechanism of the effect of TGT on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats. The plasma concentrations of losartan and EXP3174 
      were determined by LC-MS, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      calculated. The C(max) , t(1/2) and AUC((0-t)) of losartan became larger after 
      co-administration, while the C(max) and AUC((0-t)) of EXP3174 became smaller, 
      suggesting that TGT could influence the pharmacokinetics of losartan and EXP3174. 
      The effects of TGT and its main components on the metabolic rate of losartan were 
      further investigated in rat liver microsomes. Results indicated that TGT and its 
      two main ingredients could decrease the metabolic rate of losartan. Therefore, it 
      was speculated that TGT might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and 
      decrease the concentration of EXP3174 by inhibiting the metabolism of losartan. 
      The results could provide references for clinical medication guidance of losartan 
      and TGT to avoid the occurrence of adverse reactions.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of losartan.
PG  - 797-814
AB  - Losartan is the first orally available angiotensin-receptor antagonist without 
      agonist properties. Following oral administration, losartan is rapidly absorbed, 
      reaching maximum concentrations 1-2 hours post-administration. After oral 
      administration approximately 14% of a losartan dose is converted to the 
      pharmacologically active E 3174 metabolite. E 3174 is 10- to 40-fold more potent 
      than its parent compound and its estimated terminal half-life ranges from 6 to 9 
      hours. The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E 3174 are linear, dose-proportional 
      and do not substantially change with repetitive administration. The recommended 
      dosage of losartan 50 mg/day can be administered without regard to food. There 
      are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on the pharmacokinetics 
      of losartan, and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic 
      impairment or various degrees of renal insufficiency. Losartan, or its E 3174 
      metabolite, is not removed during haemodialysis. The major metabolic pathway for 
      losartan is by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C9 and 2C10 isoenzymes. Overall, 
      losartan has a favorable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack 
      of clinically relevant interactions between this drug and a range of inhibitors 
      and stimulators of the CYP450 system. Losartan does not have a drug-drug 
      interaction with hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or digoxin. Losartan should be 
      avoided in pregnancy, as is the case with all other angiotensin-receptor 
      antagonists. When given in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, losartan 
      is often associated with serious fetal toxicity. Losartan is a competitive 
      antagonist that causes a parallel rightward shift of the 
      concentration-contractile response curve to angiotensin-II, while E 3174 is a 
      noncompetitive "insurmountable" antagonist of angiotensin-II. The maximum 
      recommended daily dose of losartan is 100mg, which can be given as a once-daily 
      dose or by splitting the same total daily dose into two doses. Losartan reduces 
      blood pressure comparably to other angiotensin-receptor antagonists. Losartan has 
      been extensively studied relative to end-organ protection, with studies having 
      been conducted in diabetic nephropathy, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction 
      and hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. The results of these 
      studies have been sufficiently positive to support a more widespread use of 
      angiotensin-receptor antagonists in the setting of various end-organ diseases. 
      Losartan, like other angiotensin-receptor antagonists, is devoid of significant 
      adverse effects.

TI  - Evaluation of modafinil as a perpetrator of metabolic drug-drug interactions 
      using a model informed cocktail reaction phenotyping trial protocol.
PG  - 501-509

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the capacity for modafinil to be a perpetrator of metabolic 
      drug-drug interactions by altering cytochrome P450 activity following a single 
      dose and dosing to steady state. METHODS: A single centre, open label, single 
      sequence cocktail drug interaction trial. On days 0, 2 and 8 participants were 
      administered an oral drug cocktail comprising 100 mg caffeine, 30 mg 
      dextromethorphan, 25 mg losartan, 1 mg midazolam and 20 mg enteric-coated 
      omeprazole. Timed blood samples were collected prior to and for up to 6 h post 
      cocktail dosing. Between days 2 and 8 participants orally self-administered 
      200 mg modafinil each morning. RESULTS: Following a single 200 mg dose of 
      modafinil mean (± 95% CI) AUC ratios for caffeine, dextromethorphan, losartan, 
      midazolam and omeprazole were 0.95 (± 0.08), 1.01 (± 0.35), 0.97 (± 0.10), 0.98 
      (± 0.10) and 1.36 (± 0.06), respectively. Following dosing of modafinil to steady 
      state (200 mg for 7 days), AUC ratios for caffeine, dextromethorphan, losartan, 
      midazolam and omeprazole were 0.90 (± 0.16), 0.79 (± 0.09), 0.98 (± 0.11), 0.66 
      (± 0.12) and 1.90 (± 0.53), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data support 
      consideration of the risk of clinically relevant metabolic drug-drug interactions 
      perpetrated by modafinil when this drug is co-administered with drugs that are 
      primarily cleared by CYP2C19 (single modafinil dose or steady state modafinil 
      dosing) or CYP3A4 (steady state modafinil dosing only) catalysed metabolic 
      pathways.

TI  - Chronic central versus systemic blockade of AT(1) receptors and cardiac 
      dysfunction in rats post-myocardial infarction.
PG  - H968-75
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00317.2009 [doi]
AB  - In rats, both central and systemic ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade 
      attenuate sympathetic hyperactivity, but central blockade more effectively 
      attenuates left ventricular (LV) dysfunction post-myocardial infarction (MI). In 
      protocol I, we examined whether functional effects on cardiac load may play a 
      role and different cardiac effects disappear after withdrawal of the blockade. 
      Wistar rats were infused for 4 wk post-MI intracerebroventricularly (1 
      mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or injected subcutaneously daily (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) 
      with losartan. LV dimensions and function were assessed at 4 wk and at 6 wk 
      post-MI, i.e., 2 wk after discontinuing treatments. At 4 and 6 wk post-MI, LV 
      dimensions were increased and ejection fraction was decreased. 
      Intracerebroventricular but not subcutaneous losartan significantly improved 
      these parameters. At 6 wk, LV peak systolic pressure (LVPSP) and maximal or 
      minimal first derivative of change in pressure over time (dP/dt(max/min)) were 
      decreased and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was increased. All four indexes 
      were improved by previous intracerebroventricular losartan, whereas subcutaneous 
      losartan improved LVEDP only. In protocol II, we evaluated effects of oral 
      instead of subcutaneous administration of losartan for 4 wk post-MI. Losartan ( 
      approximately 200 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) either via drinking water or by gavage 
      similarly decreased AT(1) receptor binding densities in brain nuclei and improved 
      LVEDP but further decreased LVPSP and dP/dt(max). These results indicate that 
      effects on cardiac load by peripheral AT(1) receptor blockade or the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of subcutaneous versus oral dosing do not contribute to 
      the different cardiac effects of central versus systemic AT(1) receptor blockade 
      post-MI.

TI  - Effects of salidroside on rat CYP enzymes by a cocktail of probe drugs.
PG  - 422-426
LID - 10.22038/IJBMS.2018.26106.6414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of salidroside on the 
      activities of the different drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
      CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in rats, in which a specific probe drug was used for each 
      enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After pretreatment with salidroside, five probe 
      drugs were simultaneously administered to rats by gavage. The given dose was 2.0 
      mg/kg for phenacetin (CYP1A2 activity), 4.0 mg/kg for bupropion (CYP2B6 
      activity), 2.0 mg/kg for losartan (CYP2C9 activity), 8.0 mg/kg for metoprolol 
      (CYP2D6 activity) and 1.0 mg/kg for midazolam (CYP3A4 activity). Then, an ultra 
      performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used 
      to analyze the concentrations of rats' blood, which were collected at different 
      corresponding times. RESULTS: Our data showed that salidroside exhibited an 
      inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activities by changing the 
      main pharmacokinetic parameters (t1/2, CL/F, Cmax and AUC(0-∞)) of the four probe 
      drugs in rats. However, no significant changes in CYP2D6 activity were observed. 
      CONCLUSION: In a word, the results displayed that salidroside could induce the 
      activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which may influence the 
      disposition of the drugs that are mainly metabolized by these pathways. Our 
      research can provide the basis for the study of related herb-drug interactions in 
      clinic.

AB  - The multifactorial etiology of hypertension has promoted the research of blood 
      pressure-lowering agents with multitarget actions to achieve better clinical 
      outcomes. We describe here the discovery of novel dual-acting antihypertensive 
      codrugs combining pharmacophores with angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor 
      antagonism and neprilysin (NEP) inhibition. Specifically, the codrugs combine the 
      AT1 antagonists losartan or its carboxylic acid active metabolite (E-3174) with 
      selected monocarboxylic acid NEP inhibitors through a cleavable linker. The 
      resulting codrugs exhibited high rates of in vitro conversion into the active 
      molecules upon incubation with human/rat liver S9 fractions and in vivo 
      conversion after oral administration in rodents. Moreover, the acute effects of 
      one of the designed codrugs (3b) was confirmed at the doses of 10, 30 and 60 
      mg/kg p.o. in the spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) model, showing better 
      antihypertensive response over 24 hours than the administration of an equivalent 
      fixed-dose combination of 15 mg/kg of losartan and 14 mg/kg of the same NEP 
      inhibitor used in 3b. The results demonstrate that the codrug approach is a 
      plausible strategy to develop a single molecular entity with combined AT1 and NEP 
      activities, aiming at achieving improved pharmacokinetics, efficacy and dosage 
      convenience, as well as reduced drug-drug interaction for hypertension patients. 
      In addition, the developability of the codrug should be comparable to the one of 
      marketed AT1 antagonists, most of them prodrugs, but bearing only the AT1 
      pharmacophore.

AB  - Three new angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists, 1, 2 and 3 were designed, 
      synthesized and evaluated. The AT1 receptor-binding assays in vitro showed that 
      all the synthesized compounds had nanomolar affinity for the AT1 receptor. From 
      which compound 3 was found to be the most potent ligands with an IC50 value of 
      2.67±0.23 nM. Biological evaluation in vivo revealed that all the compounds could 
      cause significant decrease on MBP in a dose dependent manner in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats, and compound 3 especially showed an efficient and long-lasting 
      effect in reducing blood pressure, whose maximal response lowered 41 mmHg of MBP 
      at 10mg/kg and 62 mmHg at 15 mg/kg after oral administration, the significant 
      anti-hypertensive effect lasted beyond 12 h, which is better than the reference 
      compound losartan. The pharmacokinetic experiments showed that compound 3 could 
      be absorbed efficiently and metabolized smoothly both in blood and in tissues in 
      Wistar rats. The acute toxicity assay suggested that it has low toxicity with the 
      LD50 value of 2974.35 mg/kg. These results demonstrate that compound 3 is a 
      potent angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist which could be considered as a novel 
      anti-hypertension candidate and deserved for further investigation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate a strategy based on static and dynamic 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling for the prediction of 
      metabolite and parent drug area under the time-concentration curve ratio 
      (AUC(m)/AUC(p)) and their PK profiles in humans using in vitro data when active 
      transport processes are involved in disposition. The strategy was applied to 
      losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite carboxylosartan as test 
      compounds. Hepatobiliary transport including transport-mediated uptake, 
      canilicular and basolateral efflux, and metabolic clearance estimates were 
      obtained from in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and sandwich-cultured 
      hepatocytes. Human renal clearance of carboxylosartan was estimated from dog 
      renal clearance using allometric scaling approach. All clearance mechanisms were 
      mechanistically incorporated in a static model to predict the relative exposure 
      of carboxylosartan versus losartan (AUC(m)/AUC(p)). The predicted AUC(m)/AUC(p) 
      were consistent with the observed data following intravenous and oral 
      administration of losartan. Moreover, the in vitro parameters were used as 
      initial parameters in PBPK permeability-limited disposition models to predict the 
      concentration-time profiles for both parent and its active metabolite after oral 
      administration of losartan. The PBPK model was able to recover the plasma 
      profiles of both losartan and carboxylosartan, further substantiating the 
      validity of this approach.

TI  - Effect of fermented red ginseng on cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein activity in 
      healthy subjects, as evaluated using the cocktail approach.
PG  - 1580-1590
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13080 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We assessed the drug interaction profile of fermented red ginseng with 
      respect to the activity of major cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes and of a drug 
      transporter protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This 
      study was an open-label crossover study. The CYP probe cocktail drugs caffeine, 
      losartan, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, midazolam and fexofenadine were 
      administered before and after 2 weeks of fermented red ginseng administration. 
      Plasma samples were collected, and tolerability was assessed. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were calculated, and the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the 
      geometric mean ratios of the parameters were determined from logarithmically 
      transformed data. Values were compared between before and after fermented red 
      ginseng administration using analysis of variance (anova). RESULTS: Fifteen 
      healthy male subjects were evaluated, none of whom were genetically defined as a 
      poor CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 metabolizer based on genotyping. Before and after 
      fermented red ginseng administration, the geometric least-square mean metabolic 
      ratio (90% CI) was 0.901 (0.830-0.979) for caffeine (CYP1A2) to paraxanthine, 
      0.774 (0.720-0.831) for losartan (CYP2C9) to EXP3174, 1.052 (0.925-1.197) for 
      omeprazole (CYP2C19) to 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 1.150 (0.860-1.538) for 
      dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) to dextrorphan, and 0.816 (0.673-0.990) for midazolam 
      (CYP3A4) to 1-hydroxymidazolam. The geometric mean ratio of the area under the 
      curve of the last sampling time (AUC(last) ) for fexofenadine (P-gp) was 1.322 
      (1.112-1.571). CONCLUSION: No significantly different drug interactions were 
      observed between fermented red ginseng and the CYP probe substrates following the 
      two-week administration of concentrated fermented red ginseng. However, the 
      inhibition of P-gp was significantly different between fermented red ginseng and 
      the CYP probe substrates. The use of fermented red ginseng requires close 
      attention due to the potential for increased systemic exposure when it is used in 
      combination with P-gp substrate drugs.

AB  - Novel angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) blockers bearing 6-substituted 
      carbamoyl benzimidazoles with a chiral center were designed and synthesized as 
      the first step to develop new antihypertensive agents and understand their 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. The newly synthesized compounds 
      were tested for their potential ability to displace [(125)I] Sar(1) Ile(8)-Ang 
      II, which was specifically bound to human AT1 receptor. Radioligand binding 
      assays revealed nanomolar affinity in several compounds under study. The IC50 
      values of nine ligands were higher than those of Losartan. The screening of 
      decreased blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats displayed that compound 
      8S (IC₅₀ = 5.0 nM) was equipotent with Losartan, whereas compounds 13R (IC₅₀ = 
      7.3 nM), 14R (IC₅₀ = 6.3 nM), and 14S (IC₅₀ = 3.5 nM) were slightly ahead of 
      Losartan, and the most significant activity was demonstrated by compound 8R (IC₅₀ 
      = 1.1 nM). Candidate 8R was identified for its excellent efficacy in 
      antihypertension and fairly low toxicity based on plasma analyses, toxicology 
      studies, and chronic oral tests. Finally, compound 8R exhibited strong and 
      multiple interactions with target active sites of the theoretical AT1 receptor 
      model in docking study.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions of candesartan cilexetil and 
      losartan.
PG  - 561-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The variability of the blood pressure response to blockade of the 
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor is influenced by renin status and pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions of two doses of an ester prodrug of 
      a noncompetitive angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, candesartan 
      cilexetil, at 8 and 16 mg, with those of the reference angiotenisn II type 1 
      receptor blocker, losartan, at the standard dose (50 mg), in a human model that 
      controls renin status. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled 
      crossover study, we compared the effects on renin and mean blood pressure over 24 
      h of single oral doses of candesartan cilexetil at 8 and 16 mg and losartan at 50 
      mg in 16 sodium-depleted normotensive subjects. RESULTS: The area under the curve 
      (0-24 h) for plasma active renin did not differ significantly between 8 mg 
      candesartan cilexetil and 50 mg losartan, but was significantly higher for 16 
      than for 8 mg candesartan cilexetil or for 50 mg losartan. The area under the 
      curve (0-24 h) for the fall in mean blood pressure with 16 mg candesartan 
      cilexetil (-197 +/- 96 mmHg/h) was significantly greater than that for placebo 
      (-112 +/- 81 mmHg/h; P< 0.05) but the difference was not statistically 
      significant compared with either 8 mg candesartan cilexetil (-158 +/- 95 mmHg/h) 
      or 50 mg losartan (-144 +/- 66 mmHg/h). The area under the curve (0-24 h) for the 
      fall in mean blood pressure did not significantly differ between 8 mg candesartan 
      cilexetil, 50 mg losartan and placebo. The area under the curve (0-24 h) for 
      plasma active renin was significantly correlated to that for plasma levels of the 
      active metabolite of losartan, EXP 3174 (r = 0.65, n = 16, P< 0.01). No such 
      correlation was detected for each single dose of candesartan cilexetil but a 
      dose-response relationship was present when both doses were combined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral dose of 16 mg 
      candesartan cilexetil are greater than those of 50 mg losartan and 8 mg 
      candesartan cilexetil. The variability in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      interaction is less pronounced for candesartan than for EXP 3174, which could 
      result in reduced variability of the blood pressure effects in patients.

TI  - Responses to an orally active renin inhibitor, remikiren (Ro 42-5892), after 
      controlled salt depletion in humans.
PG  - 347-53
AB  - The biological effects of dose-dependent inhibition of renin have rarely been 
      extensively studied after oral (p.o.) dosing in humans. We studied remikiren 
      (Ro42-4892), a selective renin inhibitor, in normal volunteers after activation 
      of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) based on salt depletion. Twelve normal men 
      (28 +/- 9 years, 77 +/- 10 kg), comprising three consecutive dose panels of 4 
      subjects, received four treatments, double-blind and randomised 2 weeks apart: 
      panel I, placebo (P), or 30, 100, and 300 mg, remikiren; panel II, placebo or 
      300, 600 mg, 1,000; panel III, placebo or 30, 600, and 1,000 mg. The RAS was 
      activated by 40 mmol/day sodium diet plus frusemide (40 mg BDS), for 3 days 
      before each study day. Data (mean +/- SD) were examined by repeated-measures 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). RAS activation was confirmed by 24-h urinary sodium 
      excretion (screen, 142 +/- 74 mmol/24 h; prestudy, 66 +/- 33, 59 +/- 41, 78 +/- 
      4, 73 +/- 30 mmol/24 h) and increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) (screen, 0.8 
      +/- 0.3 ng AI/ml/h; before dosing, P, 6.5 +/- 3.1; 30 mg, 8.2 +/- 3; 100 mg, 9.4 
      +/- 5.7; 300 mg, 6.5 +/- 2.4; 600 mg, 5.2 +/- 2; 1,000 mg, 6.2 +/- 4.4 ng

TI  - Telmisartan is more effective than losartan in reducing proteinuria in patients 
      with diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 364-9
LID - 10.1038/ki.2008.204 [doi]
AB  - In patients with diabetic nephropathy, lowering blood pressure and reducing 
      proteinuria by over 30% correlates with a slower progression to kidney failure. 
      We compared two different angiotensin receptor-blockers in a double blind, 
      prospective trial of 860 patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood pressure 
      levels was over 130/80 mmHg or who were receiving antihypertensive medication(s) 
      and who had a morning spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio of 700 or more. 
      Patients were randomized to telmisartan (a highly lipophilic agent with a long 
      half-life) or losartan (with low lipophilicity and short half-life). The primary 
      endpoint was the difference in the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio between 
      the groups at 52 weeks. The geometric coefficient of variation and the mean of 
      the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio fell in both groups at 52 weeks but both 
      were significantly greater for the telmisartan compared to the losartan cohort. 
      Mean systolic blood pressure reductions were not significantly different between 
      groups at trial end. We conclude that telmisartan is superior to losartan in 
      reducing proteinuria in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy, despite 
      a similar reduction in blood pressure.

      losartan (DuP 753, MK-954, I), and its active metabolite, EXP3174 (II), in human 
      plasma or urine is described. The two analytes and internal standard are 
      extracted from plasma and urine at pH 2.5 by liquid-liquid extraction and 
      analyzed on a cyano column with ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. The mobile phase 
      is composed of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer at pH 2.5. The limit of 
      quantification for both compounds in plasma is 5 ng/ml. The limit in urine is 20 
      and 10 ng/ml for I and II, respectively. The assay described has been 
      successfully applied to samples from pharmacokinetic studies.

      pharmacokinetics: drug-drug interaction studies.
PG  - 575-85
LID - 10.1177/0091270010370846 [doi]
AB  - Drug interactions are a significant clinical concern, particularly in patients 
      with conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, in whom coadministration 
      of multiple drugs is common. Nebivolol is a selective β(1)-blocker with 
      vasodilatory properties approved for the treatment of hypertension. Drug-drug 
      interactions were investigated when nebivolol was coadministered to subjects 
      classified as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers who were 
      receiving other drugs commonly administered to patients with hypertension or 
      compounds metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. There were no drug-drug 
      interactions when nebivolol was coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide, 
      furosemide, ramipril, losartan, digoxin, or warfarin. Coadministration with 
      fluoxetine (also metabolized by CYP2D6) in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers impeded 
      the apparent clearance of nebivolol. The authors conclude that nebivolol is safe 
      and well tolerated regardless of genotype and type of medication coadministered.

PG  - 426-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04890.x [doi]
AB  - 1. Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. 
      Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have 
      led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren. 
      2. Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (between 2.6 and 5.0%) compensated by its 
      high potency to inhibit renin (IC50: 0.6 nmol/L) and a long plasma half-life 
      (23-36 h), which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. 3. The once-daily 
      administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as 
      standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers 
      (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan), hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin converting 
      enzyme inhibitors (ramipril and lisinopril) or long acting calcium channel 
      blockers (amlodipine). In combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood 
      pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan or 
      ramipril. 4. The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those 
      of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and Ang II antagonism, 
      particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the 
      bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the 
      (pro)renin receptor. 5. Blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE 
      inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one 
      of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. However, it remains 
      unclear how to optimize RAS blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal 
      benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the RAS fully quiescent is 
      a new possibility requiring further study.

TI  - Simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for determination of 
      losartan and E-3174 metabolite in human plasma, urine and dialysate.
PG  - 374-8
AB  - A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for 
      the determination of losartan and its E-3174 metabolite in human plasma, urine 
      and dialysate. For plasma, a gradient mobile phase consisting of 25 mM potassium 
      phosphate and acetonitrile pH 2.2 was used with a phenyl analytical column and 
      fluorescence detection. For urine and dialysate, an isocratic mobile phase 
      consisting of 25 mM potassium phosphate and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) pH 2.2 was 
      used. The method demonstrated linearity from 10 to 1000 ng/ml with a detection 
      limit of 1 ng/ml for losartan and E-3174 using 10 microl of prepared plasma, 
      urine or dialysate. The method was utilized in a study evaluating the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of losartan in patients with kidney 
      failure undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).

TI  - Combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide: in vivo bioequivalence.
PG  - 611-7
AB  - Two trials were performed in different groups of volunteers with the aim to 
      compare the bioavailability of 50 mg losartan tablets (Sarvas as test and an 
      originator product as reference formulation; study 1) and 
      losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/12.5 mg) (CAS 124750-99-8/CAS 58-93-5) 
      combined formulations (Sarvastan as test and an originator product as reference 
      formulation; study 2), respectively. Each study was conducted according to an 
      open, randomized, single-dose, two-period cross-over design in 24 healthy 
      volunteers with a wash-out period from 7 to 14 days. Blood samples were taken up 
      to 36 h in the first study and up to 48 h in the second study. Concentrations of 
      losartan and its principal active metabolite, i.e. E3174, as well as 
      hydrochlorothiazide were determined by HPLC or LC-MS-MS, respectively. In the 
      first study, the 90% confidence interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t 
      and Cmax of losartan were between 0.91 and 1.03 (AUC0-t) as well as between 0.87 
      and 1.19 (Cmax), and thus within the acceptance ranges. The 90% confidence 
      interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t, and Cmax of E3174 were between 
      0.90 and 1.13 for AUC0-t, and between 0.97 and 1.14 for Cmax. In the second 
      study, i.e. after administration of combined losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
      formulations, the 90% confidence interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t 
      and Cmax of losartan were between 0.90 and 1.04 (AUC0-t) as well as between 0.86 
      and 1.20 (Cmax). Similarly to the parent compound, no significant differences of 
      bioavailability parameters of E3174 between the two studied formulations were 
      found. The 90% confidence interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t and Cmax 
      of hydrochlorothiazide were between 0.89 and 0.98 (AUC0-t) as well as between 
      0.82 and 1.00 (Cmax). In the light of the present studies it can be concluded 
      that the losartan as well as losartan/hydrochlorothiazide test formulations are 
      bioequivalent to the respective reference formulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angiotensin receptor-NEP inhibitor (ARNi), which includes 
      an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a neprilysin inhibitor (NEPi), has been 
      proven safe and effective for treating heart failure with reduced ejection 
      fraction (HF-REF). S086 is a novel single-molecule ARNi that includes the 
      molecular moieties of EXP3174 (the active metabolite of the ARB losartan) and 
      sacubitril (a NEP inhibitor prodrug) in a 1:1 M ratio. We performed preclinical 
      animal model studies to evaluate the efficacy of S086 in treating HF. 
      EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat and dog models of myocardial ischemia-induced chronic 
      heart failure were used in this research. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The oral 
      administration of S086 dose-dependently lowered the heart weight index, 
      attenuated cardiac fibrosis, and improved left ventricular ejection fraction, 
      shortening fraction, and cardiac output, without effects on hemodynamics in 
      animal models of myocardial ischemia-induced chronic heart failure. A comparable 
      protective effect to LCZ696 was observed for S086 at an equal molar dose in dog 
      models. In addition, S086 was superior to LCZ696 since it significantly reversed 
      the decrease in left ventricular posterior wall end-systolic thickness. 
      CONCLUSION: This animal study suggests that S086 is effective in treating 
      myocardial ischemia-induced chronic heart failure.

TI  - Toxicokinetic analysis of losartan during gestation and lactation in the rat.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Previous developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in rats with losartan, a 
      potent AT1-selective angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, correlated 
      maternal treatment during gestation day (GD) 15-20 with irreversible renal 
      abnormalities in the F1 generation (Spence et al., '95a,b). Continued treatment 
      through lactation was also associated with increases in pup mortality and 
      decreases in pup body weights that persisted through weaning. The studies 
      presented here were undertaken to quantify fetal and neonatal exposure to 
      losartan when administered to the dam by oral gavage during early gestation, late 
      gestation, and lactation. Following daily oral dosing of 135 mg/kg/day on GD6-15, 
      fetal drug levels were negligible. However, losartan and its active metabolite, 
      EXP3174 (L-158,641) were readily detectable in fetal plasma on GD 20 (estimated 
      AUC values, 50.70 and 167.70 micrograms/hr/ml, respectively) and maternal milk 
      during lactation (1.61 and 1.67 micrograms/ml, respectively). These studies 
      suggest that the relative increased sensitivity of the fetus as compared to the 
      neonate for losartan-induced renal lesions is related to the degree of exposure 
      which is dependent on the time of administration (early gestation vs. late 
      gestation/lactation) and the route of exposure (transplacental or through the 
      milk). Furthermore, the maximum exposure to losartan and EXP3174 correlates with 
      the ontogeny of the renin angiotensin system on approximately GD 17 and the 
      critical period for losartan-induced renal lesions (GD15-20). The data support 
      the hypothesis that the observed adverse fetal and neonatal effects are 
      pharmacologically mediated, presumably through the lack of AT1 receptor 
      stimulation.

TI  - Carboxylesterase 2 and Intestine Transporters Contribute to the Low 
      Bioavailability of Allisartan, a Prodrug of Exp3174 for Hypertension Treatment in 
      Humans.
PG  - 843-853
LID - 10.1124/dmd.118.085092 [doi]
AB  - Exp3174 is an active metabolite of losartan for the treatment of hypertension. 
      Allisartan (ALS3) is a marketed ester prodrug of Exp3174 to reduce 
      bioavailability variation of losartan in China. However, ALS3 exhibited a lower 
      oral absorption than losartan in humans. In this study, the enzymes and 
      transporters involved in ALS3 and Exp3174 disposition were investigated to 
      clarify the mechanisms. ALS3 underwent extensive hydrolysis to Exp3174 in S9 of 
      Caco-2 cells, human intestine microsomes (HIM), recombinant carboxylesterase 
      (rCES) 1, and rCES2. ALS3 exhibited similar affinity in HIM and rCES2 with K (m) 
      values of 6.92 and 6.77 μM, respectively, indicating that ALS3 is mainly 
      hydrolyzed to Exp3174 in human intestine by CES2. Transport assays of ALS3 and 
      Exp3174 suggested that ALS3 and Exp3174 are substrates of P-glycoprotein, breast 
      cancer resistance protein, and multidrug resistance protein 2 with poor 
      permeability. Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2B1 showed higher affinity 
      and clearance toward ALS3 (K (m) 0.75 μM and intrinsic clearance 215 μl/min/mg) 
      than those of Exp3174 (K (m) 7.85 μM and intrinsic clearance 16.1 μl/min/mg), 
      indicating that ALS3 is preferred to be uptaken into intestinal epithelia. 
      Hydrolysis of ALS3 was increased from approximately 30% to 55% in 
      CES2-transfected human embryonic kidney 293-OATP2B1 cells, indicating the 
      possible interplay between OATP2B1 and CES2. The influx and efflux of ALS3 across 
      Caco-2 cells increased the potential of ALS3 hydrolysis to Exp3174, and the 
      produced Exp3174 was rapidly pumped out, which led to undetectable ALS3 and 
      Exp3174 in basolateral (receiver) side in Caco-2 cells. Overall, our study 
      provided supportive evidences that the interplay between CES2 and transporters in 
      intestine contributes to the low bioavailability of ALS3 in humans.

TI  - Prolonged angiotensin II antagonism in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 
      Hemodynamic and biochemical consequences.
PG  - 278-88
AB  - The present study examines the effects of prolonged angiotensin II antagonism in 
      spontaneously hypertensive rats by using an angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      (DuP 753) that is devoid of agonistic properties and selective for the subtype 1 
      of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptor. The antihypertensive effects of DuP 753 and 
      its effects on circulating parameters of the renin-angiotensin system were 
      compared with those of a converting enzyme inhibitor (benazeprilat). To minimize 
      any influence of differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of the two 
      blockers, administration was by continuous intravenous infusion. The experiments 
      were performed in conscious, freely moving rats with continuous 24-hour 
      monitoring of blood pressure. DuP 753 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) lowered mean arterial 
      pressure to the same extent as benazeprilat (3 or 10 mg/kg/day) during a 48-hour 
      period. The antihypertensive effect was sustained when the treatment was extended 
      to 7 days (DuP 753, 10 mg/kg/day; benazeprilat, 3 mg/kg/day). Neither of the 
      compounds affected the baseline or diurnal rhythm of heart rate. Plasma 
      concentrations of renin and angiotensin II were increased sevenfold and 10-fold, 
      respectively, in the rats treated with DuP 753. In rats treated with 
      benazeprilat, plasma renin concentration increased threefold, whereas angiotensin 
      II was unchanged. Heart weights were significantly reduced to a similar extent by 
      DuP 753 and benazeprilat. Both compounds also induced a smaller but significant 
      decrease in blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Our results indicate that the 
      antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats are mainly due to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. 
      In this rat model, angiotensin II appears to play an important role in the 
      maintenance of hypertension that is mediated via the AT1 receptor.

TI  - Effect of oral administration of losartan, prazosin, and verapamil on peritoneal 
      solute transport in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 576-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several intraperitoneally administered drugs have been shown to 
      modify transport of peritoneal solute and fluid. Fewer studies, however, have 
      evaluated the effect of orally administered drugs. The present study was 
      performed to evaluate the effects of oral losartan, prazosin, and verapamil on 
      peritoneal membrane transport during a peritoneal equilibration test (PET), as 
      well as the effects on creatinine clearance (CrCl), Kt/V urea, 24-hour protein in 
      drained dialysate, and drained volume. METHODS: This was an open, controlled, 
      crossover clinical trial performed in 20 patients on continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis. All subjects used four 2-L 1.5% glucose dialysis exchanges 
      per day. After a 7-day washout period (without antihypertensives), they had a 
      baseline standard PET and dialysis adequacy assessment performed. Subsequently, 
      they were randomly allocated to receive the first of three study drugs (losartan, 
      prazosin, and verapamil), which were administered orally for a 7-day period. 
      Immediately after each drug period, patients had a new 3-day washout and 
      subsequently started the next drug, until they had received each of the three 
      drugs. On the last day of administration of each drug, patients were subjected to 
      a new PET and adequacy of dialysis evaluation. RESULTS: None of the studied drugs 
      significantly modified the peritoneal transport of creatinine, glucose, urea, 
      sodium, potassium, or total protein as evaluated by PET. Verapamil significantly 
      increased peritoneal CrCl [51.3 (44.3 - 53.3) vs baseline 45.8 (41.4 - 50.5) 
      L/week/ 1.73 m2, p < 0.05], weekly Kt/V urea [1.75 (1.60 - 1.78) vs baseline 1.59 
      (1.54 - 1.73), p < 0.05], and drained dialysate volume [8.80 (8.30 - 8.96) vs 
      baseline 8.44 (8.20 - 8.50) L/day, p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of 
      losartan, prazosin, and verapamil did not modify the peritoneal transport of 
      solutes during a 4-hour PET. Oral verapamil significantly increased CrCl, Kt/V 
      urea, and 24-hour drained dialysate volume. It is most likely that verapamil 
      increases peritoneal (hydraulic) conductivity, and then net ultrafiltration 
      volume and convective transport of urea, creatinine, and protein. Verapamil could 
      be considered as an alternative in patients requiring increased dialysis dose 
      and/or ultrafiltration.

      study.
PG  - 1584-91
LID - 10.1002/jps.23965 [doi]
AB  - Estimation of metabolite data as a supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic 
      outcome is recommended by various guidance documents. However, a consensus on 
      using it solely to establish bioequivalence (BE) is lacking as parent drug is 
      believed to detect pharmacokinetic differences between test and reference 
      formulations better. Four BE studies of losartan potassium reported in the 
      literature are reviewed. In all the four studies, 90% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      of geometric mean ratios of the test and reference formulations for maximum blood 
      drug concentration (Cmax ) of losartan potassium were outside the acceptable 
      range of 80%-125%, whereas, 90% CIs for its active metabolite, losartan 
      carboxylic acid (LCA), were within the acceptance criteria. Although BE with 
      respect to area under the plasma concentration versus time profile curve was 
      demonstrated in all the cases, BE with respect to Cmax could not be established. 
      However, marketing authorization in all the four cases was granted based on 
      scientific evidence that LCA is 10-40 times more potent than losartan, LCA 
      exhibited higher plasma concentration levels than losartan, pharmacodynamic 
      effects correlate with LCA, and losartan shows wide therapeutic index. Further, 
      widened CI limits for losartan were accepted. Losartan presents an opportunity in 
      the diligence of the principles of quality risk management for selecting moiety 
      on which BE decision must be based.

      irbesartan. Irbesartan has the highest oral bioavailability in its class (60% to 
      80%) and, unlike valsartan, its absorption is not affected by food. Irbesartan 
      displays linear, dose related pharmacokinetics and, with the exception of 
      tasosartan's active metabolite, has the longest elimination half-life of the 
      AIIRA (11 to 15 h). Irbesartan exhibits the lowest amount of protein binding, 
      limiting its potential for drug interactions. No drug interactions with 
      irbesartan have been identified. Unlike losartan, candesartan, and tasosartan, 
      irbesartan does not require biotransformation for AII blockade. The 
      pharmacokinetics of irbesartan are not altered in renally or hepatically impaired 
      patients, probably owing to excretion characteristic by both biliary and renal 
      routes, or by differences in gender or age. Within its therapeutic dose range 
      (150 to 300 mg), irbesartan shows sustained, dose related blockade 24 h after 
      dosing. Irbesartan lowers blood pressure in a dose related manner up to 300 mg 
      daily. Some clear differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics exist 
      among the AIIRA, which may have clinical implications.

TI  - Putting the efficacy of candesartan cilexetil into perspective: a review of new 
      comparative data.
PG  - S33-41
AB  - Candesartan is one of the first angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) to 
      be developed. It binds tightly to and dissociates slowly from the angiotensin 
      subtype 1 (AT1) receptor in vitro. These binding characteristics differ from 
      those of losartan, which demonstrates lower affinity and faster dissociation from 
      the AT1 receptor. Candesartan causes long-lasting antagonism of the vascular 
      contractile response to angiotensin II compared with irbesartan, losartan or the 
      active metabolite of losartan - EXP-3174. While there are relatively few 
      distinctions that can be made between the AIIRAs in terms of their 
      pharmacokinetic profiles, the antagonistic potency of candesartan cilexetil at 
      the AT1 receptor over 24 h clearly differentiates it from other members of its 
      class. These differences are reflected in the antihypertensive efficacy and 
      duration of action of candesartan in clinical trials.

TI  - Transport-Metabolism Interplay of Atazanavir in Rat Hepatocytes.
PG  - 389-97
LID - 10.1124/dmd.115.068114 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms governing the intra- to 
      extracellular unbound concentration ratio (Kpu,u) for the HIV protease inhibitor 
      atazanavir (ATV) in rat hepatocytes. We had previously proposed a new method to 
      determine Kpu,u by using the unbound Km values from metabolism studies with 
      suspended rat hepatocytes and rat liver microsomes. Following that method, we 
      determined that the value of ATV Kpu,u was 0.32, indicating that ATV 
      hepatocellular clearance is uptake rate-limited. This hypothesis was supported by 
      the linear correlation between Kpu,u and active uptake clearance (P = 0.04; 
      R(2)=0.82) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the uptake transport 
      inhibitor losartan. Moreover, in contrast to an expected increase of Kpu,u upon 
      inhibition of ATV metabolism, a decrease of Kpu,u was observed, suggesting an 
      increased impact of sinusoidal efflux. In summary, involvement of active uptake 
      transport does not guarantee high intracellular accumulation; however, it has a 
      key role in regulating intracellular drug concentrations and drug metabolism. 
      These findings will help improve future in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolations and 
      likewise physiologically based pharmacokinetic models.

TI  - The role of endogenous angiotensin II in the regulation of renal haemodynamics 
      and proximal fluid reabsorption in the rat.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - 1. The influence of endogenous angiotensin II (AII) on renal haemodynamics and 
      tubular function was examined by clearance and micropuncture methods in 
      anaesthetized rats during AII receptor blockade with the non-peptide antagonist 
      DuP 753 (50 micrograms kg-1 min-1 i.v.). 2. Mean arterial pressure was reduced 
      slightly (-5 +/- 2 mmHg) while filtration fraction and glomerular filtration rate 
      rose by 30% without changes in renal plasma flow (RPF) or renal vascular 
      resistance (RVR). 3. Fractional proximal fluid reabsorption (calculated from 
      lithium clearance) fell from 73 to 64% (P < 0.01) and fractional distal sodium 
      reabsorption decreased from 98 to 94% (P < 0.01). 4. Urine flow rate more than 
      doubled, sodium output increased 4-fold and plasma renin concentration rose 
      8-fold while potassium excretion remained unchanged. 5. Proximal tubular fluid 
      reabsorption (Jv) as measured by shrinking split-droplet micropuncture decreased 
      by 21% (P < 0.01) during infusion of DuP 753 compared with 22.5% (P < 0.01) 
      during converting enzyme inhibition by enalaprilat (MK422). 6. Responses to DuP 
      753 were similar to those previously documented with converting enzyme inhibitors 
      except that DuP 753 failed to raise RPF. It is concluded that generation of 
      intrarenal vasodilator paracrines has confounded conclusions about the renal 
      action of converting enzyme inhibitors and we propose that in anaesthetized rats, 
      endogenous angiotensin II (AII) has its major renal influences on glomerular 
      filtration and proximal fluid reabsorption with little effect on renal vascular 
      resistance.

TI  - Grapefruit juice activates P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport.
PG  - 478-85
AB  - PURPOSE: Grapefruit juice (GJ) is known to increase the oral bioavailability of 
      many CYP3A-substrates by inhibiting intestinal phase-I metabolism. However, the 
      magnitude of AUC increase is often insignificant and highly variable. Since we 
      earlier suggested that CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) form a concerted barrier 
      to drug absorption, we investigated the role of P-gp in GJ-drug interactions. 
      METHODS: The transcellular bidirectional flux of drugs that are (i) CYP3A-and/or 
      P-gp substrates (Vinblastine, Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Fexofenadine, Losartan) or 
      that are (ii) primary CYP3A-substrates (Felodipine, Nifedipine) was evaluated 
      across MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers with or without GJ, verifying monolayer 
      integrity at all times. RESULTS: While both apical-to-basal (A-B) and 
      basal-to-apical (B-A) fluxes of all CYP3A/P-gp substrates tested were increased 
      in the presence of GJ, the resulting net efflux (B-A/A-B) was in all cases 
      significantly greater with GJ than control (Vin, 28.0 vs. 5.1; CsA, 9.9 vs. 2.8; 
      Dig, 22. 9 vs. 14.7, Fex, 22.3 vs. 11.1, Los, 39.6 vs. 26). In contrast, no such 
      GJ flux effect was observed with Fel and Nif, substrates of CYP3A only (2 vs. 1.7 
      and 1.2 vs. 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: GJ significantly activates P-gp-mediated efflux of 
      drugs that are substrates of P-gp, potentially partially counteracting the 
      CYP3A-inhibitory effects of GJ.

      Spectrometric Method for Fast Determination of Losartan in Rabbit Plasma.
PG  - 323-330
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmy114 [doi]
AB  - A rapid UPLC-MS-MS method was developed and validated for determination of 
      losartan in rabbit plasma. Protonated adducts of losartan and eprosartan (IS) 
      were monitored in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Molecular masses of daughter 
      species of losartan were m/z 423.19 > 207 and m/z 423.19 > 180; and of eprosartan 
      were m/z 425.11 > 135 and m/z 425.11 > 107. Losartan from plasma samples was 
      extracted by protein precipitation method. The mobile phase comprising water 
      (0.1% formic acid) (A) and acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) (B) was used in 
      gradient mode. Analytes were eluted on Acquity UPLC®BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm 
      column. Sample run time was 3.0 min. The validation parameters: accuracy, 
      precision and recovery were within recommended limits. Losartan as well as 
      internal standard remains stable in benchtop stability study as well as in 
      post-preparative stability study. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax (182.79 
      ± 23.80 ng/mL), Tmax (1.16 ± 0.28 h), AUC0-t (1188.57 ± 404.60 ng h/mL) and Kel 
      (0.0954 ± 0.0140 h-1) of losartan were measured. Method was successfully applied 
      for pharmacokinetic investigation in rabbits and can be used for losartan 
      determination in plasma sample obtained from other animals.

TI  - Drug absorption from the isolated perfused rat lung--correlations with drug 
      physicochemical properties and epithelial permeability.
PG  - 61-74
AB  - The pulmonary absorption of nine low-molecular-weight (225-430 Da) drugs 
      (atenolol, budesonide, enalaprilat, enalapril, formoterol, losartan, metoprolol, 
      propranolol and terbutaline) and one high-molecular-weight membrane permeability 
      marker compound (FITC-dextran 10000 Da) was investigated using the isolated, 
      perfused and ventilated rat lung (IPL). The relationships between pulmonary 
      transport characteristics, epithelial permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers and 
      drug physicochemical properties were evaluated using multivariate data analysis. 
      Finally, an in vitro-in vivo correlation was made using in vivo rat lung 
      absorption data. The absorption half-life of the investigated drugs ranged from 2 
      to 59 min, and the extent of absorption from 21 to 94% in 2 h in the isolated 
      perfused rat lung model. The apparent first-order absorption rate constant in IPL 
      (ka(lung)) was found to correlate to the apparent permeability (P(app)) of Caco-2 
      cell monolayers (r = 0.87), cLog D(7.4) (r = 0.70), cLog P, and to the molecular 
      polar surface area (%PSA) (r = -0.79) of the drugs. A Partial Least Squares 
      (PLS)-model for prediction of the absorption rate (log ka(lung)) from the 
      descriptors log P(app), %PSA and cLogD(7.4) was found (Q2 = 0.74, R2 = 0.78). 
      Furthermore, a strong in vitro-in vivo correlation (r = 0.98) was found for the 
      in vitro (IPL) drug absorption half-life and the pulmonary absorption half-life 
      obtained in rats in vivo, based on a sub-set of five compounds.

TI  - Repeated administration of Sailuotong, a fixed combination of Panax ginseng,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sailuotong (SLT) is a standard Chinese preparation made from extracts 
      of Panax ginseng (ginseng), Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo), and Crocus sativus (saffron). 
      Preliminary clinical trials and animal experiments have demonstrated that SLT 
      could improve cognition of vascular dementia (VD). PURPOSE: To avoid incident 
      drug-drug interaction which is easily encountered in patients of VD, the 
      potential influence of SLT on main drug-metabolic cytochromes P450 enzymes 
      (CYP450) was investigated. METHOD: A "cocktail probes" approach was employed to 
      evaluate the activities of CYP450. A rapid and selective analysis method was 
      developed to examine 5 CYP probe drugs and their specific metabolites in plasma 
      by using online SPE followed by a single LC-MS/MS run. After pretreatment for 2 
      weeks with SLT, ginseng, gingko, saffron or water (control), a cocktail solution 
      containing caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and midazolam was 
      given to rats orally. The plasma was obtained at different time intervals and 
      then measured for the concentration of probes and their metabolites using 
      developed SPE-LC-MS/MS method. Activity of five isozymes was estimated by 
      comparing plasma pharmacokinetics of substrates and their metabolites 
      (caffeine/paraxanthine for CYP1A2, losartan/E-3174 for CYP2C11, 
      omeprazole/5-hydroxyl omeprazole for CYP2C6, dextromethorphan/dextrophan for 
      CYP2D2 and midazolam/1-hydroxyl midazolam for CYP3A1/2) between control and drug 
      treatment groups. RESULT: Compared with control group, repeated administration of 
      SLT induced CYP1A2 by enhancing AUC (paraxanthine) / AUC (caffeine) to144%. The 
      influence is attributed to its herbal component of ginseng to a large extent. 
      Meanwhile, metabolic ability towards losartan was significantly elevated in SLT 
      and gingko group by 31% and 25% respectively, indicating weak induction of 
      CYP2C11 in rats. The analysis on probes of omeprazole and dextromethorphan showed 
      a lack of influence on CYP 2C6 and CYP2D2 in all treated groups. In terms of 
      CYP3A1/2, SLT decreased AUC ratio of 1-hydroxyl midazolam to midazolam by 39% and 
      extended the half-life of midazolam apparently. Besides, significantly decreased 
      systematic exposure of midazolam suggested the inhibition on metabolism of 
      CYP3A1/2 is likely secondary to the interaction on absorption at intestinal 
      level. The inhibition of SLT on CYP3A was likely attributed to ginseng and gingko 
      cooperatively. CONCLUSION: Further observation on herb-drug interaction should be 
      considered during clinical application of SLT.

TI  - Protection of the cardiovascular system by imidapril, a versatile 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
PG  - 93-110
AB  - Imidapril hydrochloride (imidapril) is a long-acting, non-sulfhydryl 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which has been used clinically in 
      the treatment of hypertension, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI), and diabetic nephropathy. It has the unique 
      advantage over other ACE inhibitors in causing a lower incidence of dry cough. 
      After oral administration, imidapril is rapidly converted in the liver to its 
      active metabolite imidaprilat. The plasma levels of imidaprilat gradually 
      increase in proportion to the dose, and decline slowly. The time to reach the 
      maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) is 2.0 h for imidapril and 9.3 h for 
      imidaprilat. The elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) of imidapril and imidaprilat is 
      1.7 and 14.8 h, respectively. Imidapril and its metabolites are excreted chiefly 
      in the urine. As an ACE inhibitor, imidaprilat is as potent as enalaprilat, an 
      active metabolite of enalapril, and about twice as potent as captopril. In 
      patients with hypertension, blood pressure was still decreased at 24 h after 
      imidapril administration. The antihypertensive effect of imidapril was 
      dose-dependent. The maximal reduction of blood pressure and plasma ACE was 
      achieved with imidapril, 10 mg once daily, and the additional effect was not 
      prominent with higher doses. When administered to patients with AMI, imidapril 
      improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced plasma brain natriuretic 
      peptide (BNP) levels. In patients with mild-to-moderate CHF [New York Heart 
      Association (NYHA) functional class II-III], imidapril increased exercise time 
      and physical working capacity and decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide 
      (ANP) and BNP levels in a dose-related manner. In patients with diabetic 
      nephropathy, imidapril decreased urinary albumin excretion. Interestingly, 
      imidapril improved asymptomatic dysphagia in patients with a history of stroke. 
      In the same patients it increased serum substance P levels, while the angiotensin 
      II receptor antagonist losartan was ineffective. These studies indicate that 
      imidapril is a versatile ACE inhibitor. In addition to its effectiveness in the 
      treatment of hypertension, CHF, and AMI, imidapril has beneficial effects in the 
      treatment of diabetic nephropathy and asymptomatic dysphagia. Good tissue 
      penetration and inhibition of tissue ACE by imidapril contributes to its 
      effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. The 
      major advantages of imidapril are its activity in the treatment of various 
      cardiovascular diseases and lower incidence of cough compared with some of the 
      older ACE inhibitors.
