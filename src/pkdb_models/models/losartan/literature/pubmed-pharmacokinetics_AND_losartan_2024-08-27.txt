TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of losartan.
PG  - 797-814
AB  - Losartan is the first orally available angiotensin-receptor antagonist without 
      agonist properties. Following oral administration, losartan is rapidly absorbed, 
      reaching maximum concentrations 1-2 hours post-administration. After oral 
      administration approximately 14% of a losartan dose is converted to the 
      pharmacologically active E 3174 metabolite. E 3174 is 10- to 40-fold more potent 
      than its parent compound and its estimated terminal half-life ranges from 6 to 9 
      hours. The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E 3174 are linear, dose-proportional 
      and do not substantially change with repetitive administration. The recommended 
      dosage of losartan 50 mg/day can be administered without regard to food. There 
      are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on the pharmacokinetics 
      of losartan, and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic 
      impairment or various degrees of renal insufficiency. Losartan, or its E 3174 
      metabolite, is not removed during haemodialysis. The major metabolic pathway for 
      losartan is by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C9 and 2C10 isoenzymes. Overall, 
      losartan has a favorable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack 
      of clinically relevant interactions between this drug and a range of inhibitors 
      and stimulators of the CYP450 system. Losartan does not have a drug-drug 
      interaction with hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or digoxin. Losartan should be 
      avoided in pregnancy, as is the case with all other angiotensin-receptor 
      antagonists. When given in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, losartan 
      is often associated with serious fetal toxicity. Losartan is a competitive 
      antagonist that causes a parallel rightward shift of the 
      concentration-contractile response curve to angiotensin-II, while E 3174 is a 
      noncompetitive "insurmountable" antagonist of angiotensin-II. The maximum 
      recommended daily dose of losartan is 100mg, which can be given as a once-daily 
      dose or by splitting the same total daily dose into two doses. Losartan reduces 
      blood pressure comparably to other angiotensin-receptor antagonists. Losartan has 
      been extensively studied relative to end-organ protection, with studies having 
      been conducted in diabetic nephropathy, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction 
      and hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. The results of these 
      studies have been sufficiently positive to support a more widespread use of 
      angiotensin-receptor antagonists in the setting of various end-organ diseases. 
      Losartan, like other angiotensin-receptor antagonists, is devoid of significant 
      adverse effects.

TI  - Losartan Blocks Osteosarcoma-Elicited Monocyte Recruitment, and Combined With the 
      Kinase Inhibitor Toceranib, Exerts Significant Clinical Benefit in Canine 
      Metastatic Osteosarcoma.
PG  - 662-676
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-2105 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is increasing recognition that progress in immuno-oncology could 
      be accelerated by evaluating immune-based therapies in dogs with spontaneous 
      cancers. Osteosarcoma (OS) is one tumor for which limited clinical benefit has 
      been observed with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We previously 
      reported the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan suppressed metastasis in 
      preclinical mouse models through blockade of CCL2-CCR2 monocyte recruitment. Here 
      we leverage dogs with spontaneous OS to determine losartan's safety and 
      pharmacokinetics associated with monocyte pharmacodynamic endpoints, and assess 
      its antitumor activity, in combination with the kinase inhibitor toceranib. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCL2 expression, monocyte infiltration, and monocyte 
      recruitment by human and canine OS tumors and cell lines were assessed by gene 
      expression, ELISA, and transwell migration assays. Safety and efficacy of 
      losartan-toceranib therapy were evaluated in 28 dogs with lung metastatic OS. 
      Losartan PK and monocyte PD responses were assessed in three dose cohorts of dogs 
      by chemotaxis, plasma CCL2, and multiplex cytokine assays, and RNA-seq of 
      losartan-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Human and 
      canine OS cells secrete CCL2 and elicit monocyte migration, which is inhibited by 
      losartan. Losartan PK/PD studies in dogs revealed that a 10-fold-higher dose than 
      typical antihypertensive dosing was required for blockade of monocyte migration. 
      Treatment with high-dose losartan and toceranib was well-tolerated and induced a 
      clinical benefit rate of 50% in dogs with lung metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Losartan 
      inhibits the CCL2-CCR2 axis, and in combination with toceranib, exerts 
      significant biological activity in dogs with metastatic osteosarcoma, supporting 
      evaluation of this drug combination in patients with pediatric osteosarcoma. See 
      related commentary by Weiss et al., p. 571.

TI  - Influence of CYP2C9 Genetic Polymorphisms on the Pharmacokinetics of Losartan and 
      Its Active Metabolite E-3174: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11070617 [doi]
LID - 617
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the influence of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on 
      the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, through a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis. Eight studies published before March 2021 
      were included in this study. We used PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and 
      Web of Science, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The data analysis was conducted through Review 
      Manager (RevMan), version 5.3, and R software. We found that healthy volunteers 
      with CYP2C9*2 or *3 carriers had higher area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)) of 
      losartan (mean difference (MD) 0.17 μg·h/mL; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.04, 
      0.29) and lower AUC(0-∞) of E-3174 (MD -0.35 μg·h/mL; 95% CI: -0.62, -0.08) than 
      those with CYP2C9*1/*1. Subjects with CYP2C9*2 or *3 carriers showed lower 
      maximum concentration (C(max)) of E-3174 than those with CYP2C9*1/*1 (MD -0.13 
      μg/mL; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.09). For half-life, subjects with CYP2C9*2 or *3 
      carriers had longer half-lives of losartan and E-3174 than those with CYP2C9*1/*1 
      (MD 0.47 h; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.61 and MD 0.68 h; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.92, respectively). 
      This meta-analysis suggests that the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 are 
      associated with the CYP2C9 polymorphisms.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Amlodipine/Losartan and 
      Chlorthalidone Compared to Concurrent Administration of the Separate Components.
PG  - 91-99
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.963 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is more effectively treated with coadministration of 2 or more 
      antihypertensive drugs than with high-dose monotherapy. Therefore, calcium 
      channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and thiazides are 
      coadministered to treat hypertension. The objective of this study was to compare 
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of HCP1401, a fixed-dose combination of 
      amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and chlorthalidone 25 mg, with the separate 
      components (loose combination) of amlodipine/losartan 5/100 mg and chlorthalidone 
      25 mg. A randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover study was 
      conducted. Blood samples for amlodipine and chlorthalidone were collected for up 
      to 144 hours after dosing, whereas those for losartan were collected up to 48 
      hours after dosing. The PK parameters of these drugs were calculated using a 
      noncompartmental method. Sixty subjects completed the study. The geometric mean 
      ratios and 90% confidence intervals of maximum plasma concentration and area 
      under the concentration-time curve to the last measurable point for amlodipine, 
      losartan, and chlorthalidone were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 
      0.80 to 1.25. There were no clinically significant changes in safety assessments, 
      and the treatments were well tolerated. The PK characteristics and tolerability 
      profiles of a single oral FDC of amlodipine, losartan, and chlorthalidone were 
      equivalent to those of individual tablets in a loose combination.

AB  - 1. This study investigates the influence of quercetin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan and its metabolite EXP3174 in rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      losartan and EXP3174 of orally administered losartan (10 mg/kg) with or without 
      pretreatment with quercetin (20 mg/kg/day for 7 days) were investigated. 
      Additionally, Caco-2 cell transwell model and rat liver microsome incubation 
      experiments were also conducted to investigate its potential mechanism. 3. The 
      results showed that when the rats were pretreated with quercetin, the C(max) 
      (2.16 ± 0.40 vs. 1.33 ± 0.21 mg/L) and the AUC((0-t)) (13.89 ± 1.22 vs. 
      7.34 ± 0.75 mg·h/L) of losartan increased significantly (p < .05), and while the 
      C(max) (0.76 ± 0.09 vs. 1.14 ± 0.18 mg/L) of EXP3174 decreased significantly 
      compared to the control (p < .05). The t(1/2) of losartan was prolonged from 
      3.27 ± 0.45 h to 4.74 ± 0.51 h (p < .05). The results also indicated that 
      quercetin could increase losartan absorption rate by inhibiting the activity of 
      P-gp and decrease its metabolic stability by inhibiting the activity of CYP450 
      enzyme. 4. These results indicated that the herb-drug interaction between 
      quercetin and losartan might occur when they are co-administered in rats, 
      quercetin could increase the systemic exposure of losartan and decrease the 
      plasma concentration of EXP3174, possibly by inhibiting the activity of P-gp or 
      CYP450 enzyme.

TI  - Changes in Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Losartan in Experimental 
      Diseased Rats Treated with Curcuma longa and Lepidium sativum.
LID - 10.3390/ph16010033 [doi]
LID - 33
AB  - The current study investigated “pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics 
      interactions” of losartan with Curcuma longa (CUR) and Lepidium sativum (LS) in 
      hypertensive rats. Hypertension was induced by oral administration of L-NAME (40 
      mg/kg) for two weeks. Oral administration of CUR or LS shows some substantial 
      antihypertensive activity. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) of hypertensive rats 
      was decreased by 7.04% and 8.78% 12 h after treatment with CUR and LS, 
      respectively, as compared to rats treated with L-NAME alone. LS and CUR display 
      the ability to potentiate the blood pressure-lowering effects of losartan in 
      hypertensive rats. A greater decrease in SBP, by 11.66% and 13.74%, was observed 
      in hypertensive rats treated with CUR + losartan and LS + losartan, respectively. 
      Further, both the investigated herbs, CUR and LS, caused an increase in plasma 
      concentrations of losartan in hypertensive rats. The AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and 
      AUMC0-inf of losartan were increased by 1.25-fold, 1.28-fold and 1.09-fold in 
      hypertensive rats treated with CUR + losartan. A significant (p < 0.05) increase 
      in AUC0-t (2.41-fold), AUC0-inf (3.86-fold) and AUMC0-inf (8.35-fold) of losartan 
      was observed in hypertensive rats treated with LS + losartan. The present study 
      affirms that interactions between CUR or LS with losartan alter both 
      “pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics” of the drug. Concurrent administration of 
      losartan with either CUR or LS would require dose adjustment and intermittent 
      blood pressure monitoring for clinical use in hypertensive patients. Additional 
      investigation is necessary to determine the importance of these interactions in 
      humans and to elucidate the mechanisms of action behind these interactions.

TI  - Effect of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism and breviscapine on losartan 
      pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.
PG  - 616-623

AB  - 1. Breviscapine was an active ingredient of flavonoid glycosides. Our present 
      study was conducted to evaluate the impact of breviscapine on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite E-3174, and that 
      relationship with the gene polymorphism of CYP2C9 in healthy Chinese volunteers, 
      to provide a basis for clinical rational drug use.2. The genotypes of 217 healthy 
      Chinese subjects were determined using PCR-RFLP. Twelve healthy subjects were 
      selected and were known CYP2C9 genotypes (six CYP2C9*1/*3 and six CYP2C9*1/*1) in 
      a two-phase randomised crossover design study. These subjects were given daily 
      doses of 120 mg (40 mg, three times a day) of breviscapine or a placebo for 
      14 days, followed by 50 mg losartan on day 15.3. Compared with individuals 
      carrying the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype showed an increase in 
      the AUC((0-36)) (833.6 ± 379.8 ng h ml(-1) vs. 526.1 ± 140.1 ng h ml(-1), 
      p < 0.05) and a decrease in the MR (the metabolic ratio of losartan, 
      AUC(E-3174)/AUC(losartan)) (2.67 ± 1.40 vs. 4.56 ± 0.83, p < 0.05) of losartan 
      during the placebo treatment phase. Individuals with genotype CYP2C9*1/*3 showed 
      a significant increase in AUC((0-36)) (2335 ± 851.8 ng h ml(-1) vs. 
      1927 ± 949.5 ng h ml(-1), p < 0.05) and AUC((0-∞)) (2363 ± 875.6 ng h ml(-1) vs. 
      1966 ± 966.1 ng h ml(-1), p < 0.05) of E-3174 after breviscapine treatment 
      compared to the placebo group.4. In healthy subjects, breviscapine had no 
      significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of losartan. The activity of CYP2C9 
      enzyme to losartan metabolism was more significant in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3 
      than those with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype.

TI  - Losartan does not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin.
PG  - 1008-15
AB  - Losartan, on orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist is 
      being developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of hypertension and 
      heart failure. Many patients requiring anticoagulant therapy with warfarin also 
      may have hypertension or heart failure, and thus, are potential candidates for 
      losartan therapy. This study was designed to investigate whether losartan at 
      likely dosage levels would alter the anticoagulant response to warfarin. In a 
      two-period, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, ten healthy male 
      subjects received a single oral dose of 30 mg warfarin sodium on the seventh day 
      of a 13-day treatment with losartan, 100 mg daily by mouth, or placebo. Multiple 
      plasma samples were collected over a 6-day period after both warfarin doses for 
      the measurements of R- and S-warfarin concentrations and prothrombin times. The 
      pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin were comparable in the absence and presence 
      of losartan (no significant effects of losartan on area under the curve, Cmax, or 
      tmax). Losartan also had no significant effect on the anticoagulant effect of 
      warfarin, as assessed by the area under the prothrombin time versus time curve 
      and the maximum response for prothrombin time. The lack of pharmacokinetic or 
      pharmacodynamic interaction between warfarin and losartan observed in this 
      investigation suggests that a clinically important interaction between these 
      drugs is unlikely to occur in patients requiring concomitant administration of 
      both drugs.

TI  - Comparison of Pharmacokinetics of a Fixed-Dose Combination of 
      Amlodipine/Losartan/Rosuvastatin with Concomitant Administration of 
      Amlodipine/Losartan and Rosuvastatin in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 661-668
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S233014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet formulation of 
      amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin 5/100/20 mg was developed to improve medication 
      compliance in patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia. The comparative 
      pharmacokinetic study was performed to compare the profile of an FDC tablet 
      formulation of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin with that of concomitant 
      administration of a currently marketed FDC tablet of amlodipine/losartan with a 
      rosuvastatin tablet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, single oral 
      dose, two-way crossover study was conducted in 60 healthy subjects. Subjects were 
      orally administered the FDC tablet of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin and a 
      loose combination (LC) of two tablets comprising an FDC of amlodipine/losartan 
      and rosuvastatin. Blood samples were collected for up to 144 h post dose for 
      pharmacokinetic evaluations. Plasma concentrations of amlodipine, losartan, 
      EXP3174 (an active metabolite of losartan), and rosuvastatin were measured by 
      using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The geometric mean ratio 
      (GMR) and its 90% confidence interval (90% CI) in the FDC treatment to LC 
      treatment for the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to the last 
      quantifiable time point (AUC(last)) and the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      were calculated. Safety was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: The GMR (90% 
      CI) values of AUC(last) and C(max) were 0.9946 (0.9663-1.0238) and 0.9690 
      (0.9379-1.0011) for amlodipine, 0.9855 (0.9422-1.0308) and 0.9178 (0.8349-1.0089) 
      for losartan, 0.9814 (0.9501-1.0136) and 0.9756 (0.9313-1.0219) for EXP3174, and 
      0.9448 (0.8995-0.9923) and 0.9609 (0.8799-1.0494) for rosuvastatin, respectively. 
      No clinically significant changes were observed in any of the safety parameters, 
      including clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and 
      physical examinations, between the FDC treatment and the LC treatment. 
      CONCLUSION: We confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the FDC and LC 
      treatments. This triple combination FDC formulation could be a clinically useful 
      replacement for LC therapy.

TI  - Effects of berberine on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite 
      EXP3174 in rats and its mechanism.
PG  - 2886-2894
AB  - CONTEXT: Losartan and berberine (BBR) are often simultaneously used for the 
      treatment of senile diabetic nephropathy in clinics. However, the potential 
      herb-drug interaction between losartan and BBR is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigates the influence of BBR on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      EXP3174, and investigates the effects of BBR on the metabolic stability of 
      losartan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacokinetic profiles losartan and 
      EXP3174 of orally administered losartan (10 mg/kg) with and without pretreatment 
      with BBR (20 mg/kg) within 24 h were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats. The 
      inhibitory effects of BBR on the metabolic stability of losartan were 
      investigated using rat liver microsomes. RESULTS: The C(max) (1.26 ± 0.37 versus 
      1.96 ± 0.45 mg/L) and the AUC((0-)(t)()) (8.25 ± 0.89 versus 12.70 ± 1.42 mg h/L) 
      of losartan were significantly (p < 0.05) increased by BBR compared to the 
      control, while the C(max) (0.97 ± 0.15 versus 0.77 ± 0.06 mg/L) of EXP3174 was 
      significantly decreased compared to the control (p < 0.05). The T(max) of 
      losartan was prolonged from 0.41 ± 0.12 to 0.52 ± 0.18 h, but the difference was 
      not significant. However, the T(max) of EXP3174 was decreased significantly 
      (p < 0.05) from 8.14 ± 0.36 to 3.33 ± 0.28 h. The metabolic stability of losartan 
      was increased from 37.4 to 59.6 min. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We infer that BBR 
      might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and decrease the 
      concentration of EXP3174 through inhibiting the activity of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9.

TI  - Comparative pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of candesartan and losartan in 
      man.
PG  - 1075-83
AB  - The angiotensin II antagonistic effects of candesartan and losartan were compared 
      in-vivo after single and repeated doses. Effects were related to antagonistic 
      activity in plasma. In this double-blind, crossover study, 12 healthy male 
      volunteers received, in random order, daily oral doses of 8 mg candesartan 
      cilexetil or 50 mg losartan for seven days. On day 1 and day 8, dynamics and 
      kinetics were assessed up to 48 h after dosing. Antagonistic effect was 
      determined from the antagonist-induced rightward shifts of the diastolic blood 
      pressure response curves to exogenously administered angiotensin II measured as 
      the dose ratio (DR). The antagonistic activity in plasma was measured using an 
      ex-vivo/in-vitro radioreceptor assay. Specific high-performance liquid 
      chromatography assays determined plasma concentrations of candesartan, losartan 
      and its active metabolite EXP-3174. The pharmacokinetic properties of candesartan 
      and losartan were comparable and antagonistic activity in plasma almost identical 
      (ratio candesartan: losartan = 0.97 and 1-2 after single and multiple doses, 
      respectively). However, the antagonistic effects of candesartan and losartan 
      in-vivo were quite different. Twenty-four hours after single dosing with 
      candesartan a clinically relevant rightward shift in the angiotensin II 
      dose-response curve (DR= 3.2) occurred that was more pronounced than that 
      following losartan administration (DR=2.1, ratio candesartan: losartan= 1.65). 
      Twenty-four hours after multiple doses of candesartan or losartan, the values of 
      the DR were 4.8 and 2.3, respectively (ratio candesartan: losartan = 1.94). The 
      values of DR for candesartan were significantly higher compared with losartan 
      between 6 and 36h after a single dose and between 3 and 24 h post-dose following 
      multiple dose administration. A counter-clockwise hysteresis was apparent between 
      antagonistic activity in plasma and antagonistic effect. Despite equivalent 
      angiotensin II antagonistic activity in plasma, the pharmacodynamic effect of 
      candesartan cilexetil was greater than that of losartan. Candesartan appeared to 
      have a slower off-rate from the angiotensin AT1-receptor compared with losartan, 
      nevertheless differences in distributional phenomena or the extent of 
      insurmountable antagonistic activity cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite E-3174 in relation to the CYP2C9 
      genotype.
PG  - 89-98
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Losartan is metabolized by polymorphic CYP2C9 to E-3174. Our 
      aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 in relation to 
      the CYP2C9 genotype. METHODS: A 50-mg oral dose of losartan was given to 22 
      Swedish volunteers with different CYP2C9 genotypes. Losartan and E-3174 were 
      analyzed by HPLC in plasma and urine samples collected up to 24 hours after drug 
      intake. Furthermore, losartan and E-3174 were analyzed in 8-hour urine samples 
      collected from 17 Spanish subjects after a single oral dose of 25 mg losartan. 
      RESULTS: The maximum plasma concentration of E-3174 was significantly (P <.05) 
      lower in the CYP2C9*1/*3 (n = 5) and CYP2C9*2/*3 (n = 4) groups compared with the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 (n = 6) and CYP2C9*1/*2 (n = 3) groups and extremely low in 1 subject 
      with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. The ratio of the total losartan area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) to the total E-3174 AUC 
      (AUC(losartan)/AUC(E-3174)) was higher in the subject with the CYP2C9*3/*3 
      genotype (30-fold) and also in the CYP2C9*1/*3 and *2/*3 groups (approximately 2- 
      and 3-fold, respectively) compared with the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The plasma ratios 
      correlated significantly with the 0- to 8-hour urinary losartan/E-3174 ratios. 
      Among the total of 39 subjects, the urinary ratio was significantly higher in 
      subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*3 (n = 10) and *2/*3 (n = 4) genotypes than in those 
      with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (n = 11; P <.01) and approximately 40-fold higher 
      in subjects with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype (n = 3). CONCLUSION: The CYP2C9*3 
      allele was shown to be associated with decreased formation of E-3174 from 
      losartan. The significant differences between genotypes in plasma and urine 
      losartan/E-3174 ratios and the good correlation between the plasma and urine 
      ratios suggest that the losartan/E-3174 ratio in 0- to 8-hour urine specimens may 
      serve as a phenotyping assay for CYP2C9 activity. Further studies in larger 
      populations will be required to establish this.

TI  - Evaluation of Cytochrome P450-Mediated Cannabinoid-Drug Interactions in Healthy 
      Adult Participants.
PG  - 693-703
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2973 [doi]
AB  - Understanding cannabis-drug interactions is critical given regulatory changes 
      that have increased access to and use of cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) and 
      Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoids, are in 
      vitro reversible and time-dependent (CBD only) inhibitors of several cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) enzymes. Cannabis extracts were used to evaluate quantitatively 
      potential pharmacokinetic cannabinoid-drug interactions in 18 healthy adults. 
      Participant received, in a randomized cross-over manner (separated by ≥ 1 week), 
      a brownie containing (i) no cannabis extract (ethanol/placebo), (ii) CBD-dominant 
      cannabis extract (640 mg CBD + 20 mg Δ9-THC), or (iii) Δ9-THC-dominant cannabis 
      extract (20 mg Δ9-THC and no CBD). After 30 minutes, participants consumed a 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) drug cocktail consisting of caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan 
      (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A). 
      Plasma and urine samples were collected (0-24 hours). The CBD + Δ9-THC brownie 
      inhibited CYP2C19 > CYP2C9 > CYP3A > CYP1A2 (but not CYP2D6) activity, as 
      evidenced by an increase in the geometric mean ratio of probe drug area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) relative to placebo (AUC(GMR) ) of 
      omeprazole, losartan, midazolam, and caffeine by 207%, 77%, 56%, and 39%, 
      respectively. In contrast, the Δ9-THC brownie did not inhibit any of the CYPs. 
      The CBD + Δ9-THC brownie increased Δ9-THC AUC(GMR) by 161%, consistent with CBD 
      inhibiting CYP2C9-mediated oral Δ9-THC clearance. Except for caffeine, these 
      interactions were well-predicted by our physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
      model (within 26% of observed interactions). Results can be used to help guide 
      dose adjustment of drugs co-consumed with cannabis products and the dose of CBD 
      in cannabis products to reduce interaction risk with Δ9-THC.

TI  - Losartan Potassium and Verapamil Hydrochloride Compound Transdermal Drug Delivery 
      System: Formulation and Characterization.

LID - 13051
AB  - In this study, we developed a sustained-release transdermal delivery system 
      containing losartan potassium (LP) and verapamil hydrochloride (VPH). LP and VPH 
      have low bioavailability and long half-life. Therefore, the development of an 
      optimum administration mode is necessary to overcome these drawbacks and enhance 
      the antihypertensive effect. A transdermal diffusion meter was used to determine 
      the optimal formulation of LP-VPH transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS). Based 
      on in vitro results, a sustained-release patch was prepared. Physical 
      characteristics, including quality, stickiness, and appearance, were evaluated in 
      vitro, while pharmacokinetics and skin irritation were evaluated in vivo. The 
      results showed that 8.3% polyvinyl alcohol, 74.7% polyvinylpyrrolidone K30, 12% 
      oleic acid-azone, and 5% polyacrylic acid resin II provided an optimized TDDS 
      product for effective administration of LP and VPH. Furthermore, in vitro and in 
      vivo release tests showed that the system continuously released LP and VPH for 24 
      h. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that although the maximum concentration 
      was lower, both the area under the curve from 0-time and the mean residence time 
      of the prepared patch were significantly higher than those of the oral 
      preparations. Furthermore, the prepared LP-VPH transdermal patch showed good 
      stability and no skin irritation. The developed LP-VPH TDDS showed a 
      sustained-release effect and good characteristics and pharmacokinetics; 
      therefore, it is an ideal formulation.

TI  - Losartan and E3174 pharmacokinetics in cytochrome P450 2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, and *1/*3 
      individuals.
PG  - 720-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if differences in the pharmacokinetics of losartan 
      and its pharmacologically active E3174 metabolite exist among individuals 
      expressing the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, and *1/*3 genotypes. 
      DESIGN: Single-dose pharmacokinetic study. SETTING: University general clinical 
      research center. SUBJECTS: Fifteen healthy volunteers, five from each genotype: 
      CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, and *1/*3. INTERVENTION: A single oral dose of losartan 50 
      mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma and urine samples were collected for 24 
      hours, and losartan and E3174 pharmacokinetic data were compared across the three 
      genotypes. Orthostatic blood pressure was measured over 12 hours after dosing. No 
      significant differences were observed among the three groups in losartan or E3174 
      area under the plasma concentration-time curve, losartan or E3174 elimination 
      half-life, or losartan oral clearance. A significant association between CYP2C9 
      genotype and losartan to E3174 formation clearance was observed, such that 50% of 
      the variability was accounted for by the genotype. No significant relationship 
      between that genotype and blood pressure was observed at any time. CONCLUSION: 
      Differences in the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active E3174 metabolite 
      were not observed in healthy subjects with the genotype of CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 
      compared with those expressing *1/*1. Alterations in losartan dosing in 
      CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 individuals does not appear necessary.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 in 
      five ethnic populations of China.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Interethnic variability in drug pharmacokinetics is 
      well known. Our aim was to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of losartan 
      and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 vary between subjects of five 
      Chinese ethnicities (Han, Mongolian, Korean, Hui and Uigur). METHODS: Fifty 
      healthy subjects (five men and five women of each ethnicity) were recruited, and 
      each received 50-mg dose of losartan in tablet form. Fourteen blood samples were 
      collected for each subject over a 24-h period after drug administration. The 
      concentrations of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 in 
      plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence 
      (HPLC/FLU) method, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 2.0 
      software and compared by SPSS 16.0 software. Pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      including area under the curve from 0h to the last measured point 24h 
      [AUC((0-24))], area under the curve from 0h to infinite time [AUC((0-∞))], peak 
      plasma concentration (C(max) ), time to reach C(max) (t(max) ), oral clearance 
      (CL), oral volume of distribution (V(d)) and elimination half-life (t(1/2) ), 
      were determined following a single oral dose of losartan. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 
      The t(1/2) values of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 
      showed significant differences across the five ethnicities. After normalization 
      by weight, no ethnicity-based difference was noted in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of losartan. However, there were significant differences in C(max) and 
      V(d) of the active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174 for Han and Mongolian 
      subjects, compared with the other three ethnic groups. There was a high linear 
      correlation between weight and C(max) , AUC((0-24)) , AUC((0-∞)) , CL and V(d) . 
      WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Ethnicity was associated with significant differences 
      in the single-dose pharmacokinetics of losartan's active carboxylic acid 
      metabolite E-3174 in healthy subjects of the five main ethnic groups in China.

TI  - The effect of tripterygium glucoside tablet on pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      its metabolite EXP3174 in rats.
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3973 [doi]
AB  - Losartan and tripterygium glucoside tablet (TGT) are often simultaneously used 
      for reducing urine protein excretion in clinic. However, it is unknown whether 
      there is potential herb-drug interaction between losartan and TGT. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate their potential herb-drug interaction, and clarify 
      the mechanism of the effect of TGT on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats. The plasma concentrations of losartan and EXP3174 
      were determined by LC-MS, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      calculated. The C(max) , t(1/2) and AUC((0-t)) of losartan became larger after 
      co-administration, while the C(max) and AUC((0-t)) of EXP3174 became smaller, 
      suggesting that TGT could influence the pharmacokinetics of losartan and EXP3174. 
      The effects of TGT and its main components on the metabolic rate of losartan were 
      further investigated in rat liver microsomes. Results indicated that TGT and its 
      two main ingredients could decrease the metabolic rate of losartan. Therefore, it 
      was speculated that TGT might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and 
      decrease the concentration of EXP3174 by inhibiting the metabolism of losartan. 
      The results could provide references for clinical medication guidance of losartan 
      and TGT to avoid the occurrence of adverse reactions.

TI  - Effects of ticlopidine on pharmacokinetics of losartan and its main metabolite 
      EXP-3174 in rats.
PG  - 967-72
LID - 10.1038/aps.2011.32 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Losartan and antiplatelet agent ticlopidine can be prescribed concomitantly 
      for prevention or therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the effects of 
      ticlopidine on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite 
      EXP-3174 were evaluated in rats. METHODS: Ticlopidine (4 or 10 mg/kg po) was 
      administered 30 min before administration of losartan (9 mg/kg po or 3 mg/kg iv). 
      The activity of human CYP2C9 and 3A4 were measured using the CYP inhibition assay 
      kit. The activity of P-gp was evaluated using rhodamine-123 retention assay in 
      MCF-7/ADR cells. RESULTS: Ticlopidine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the 
      areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) of oral losartan (9 mg/kg), as well as the AUCs of the 
      active metabolite EXP-3174. Ticlopidine (10 mg/kg) did not significantly change 
      the pharmacokinetics of intravenous losartan (3 mg/kg). Ticlopidine inhibited 
      CYP2C9 and 3A4 with IC₅₀ values of 26.0 and 32.3 μmol/L, respectively. The 
      relative cellular uptake of rhodamine-123 was unchanged. CONCLUSION: The 
      significant increase in the AUC of losartan (9 mg/kg) by ticlopidine (10 mg/kg) 
      could be attributed to the inhibition of CYP2C9- and 3A4-mediated losartan 
      metabolism in small intestine and/or in liver. The inhibition of P-gp in small

TI  - Effects of Ginkgo leaf tablets on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats and its mechanism.
PG  - 333-336
LID - 10.1080/13880209.2018.1481107 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Ginkgo leaf tablets (GLTs) and losartan are often simultaneously used 
      for the treatment of hypertension in Chinese clinics. However, the herb-drug 
      interaction between GLT and losartan is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigates the effects of GLT on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats and its potential mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The pharmacokinetic profiles of losartan and EXP3174 of orally administered 
      losartan (10 mg/kg) with or without GLT pretreatment (80 mg/kg/day for 10 days) 
      in Sprague-Dawley rats were determined. In vitro, the effects of GLT on the 
      metabolic stability of losartan were investigated with rat liver microsomes. 
      RESULTS: The C(max) (1.22 ± 0.25 vs 1.85 ± 0.37 μg/mL) and the AUC((0-)(t)()) 
      (6.99 ± 1.05 vs 11.94 ± 1.79 mg·h/L) of losartan increased significantly 
      (p < 0.05) with GLT pretreatment, while the C(max) (1.05 ± 0.19 vs 
      0.72 ± 0.12 μg/mL) of EXP3174 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the 
      control. The t(1/2) of losartan was prolonged significantly from 3.94 ± 0.62 to 
      4.75 ± 0.52 h (p < 0.05). The metabolic stability of losartan was increased from 
      37.4 min to 59.6 min with GLT pretreatment. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results indicate that GLT might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and 
      decrease the concentration of EXP3174 through inhibiting the metabolism of 
      losartan.

TI  - Frequency of CYP2C9 alleles in Koreans and their effects on losartan 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 1303-8
LID - 10.1038/aps.2011.100 [doi]
AB  - AIM: CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes numerous clinically important drugs. The aim of 
      this study is to investigate the frequencies of CYP2C9 genotypes and the effects 
      of selected alleles on losartan pharmacokinetics in a large sample of the Korean 
      population. METHODS: The CYP2C9 gene was genotyped in 1796 healthy Korean 
      subjects. CYP2C9 alleles (CYP2C9*1, *2, *3 and *13 alleles) were measured using 
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
      assay and direct sequencing assay. The enzymatic activity of each CYP2C9 genotype 
      was evaluated using losartan as the substrate. RESULTS: The frequencies of 
      CYP2C9*1, *3 and *13 allele were 0.952 (95% confidence interval 0.945-0.959), 
      0.044 (95% CI 0.037-0.051) and 0.005 (95% CI 0.003-0.007), respectively. The 
      frequencies of the CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*3, *1/*13 and *3/*3 genotypes were 0.904 (95% 
      CI 0.890-0.918), 0.085 (95% CI 0.072-0.098), 0.009 (95% CI 0.005-0.013) and 0.001 
      (95% CI 0.000-0.002), respectively. In the pharmacokinetics studies, the AUC(0-∞) 
      of losartan in CYP2C9*3/*3 subjects was 1.42-fold larger than that in CYP2C9*1/*1 
      subjects, and the AUC(0-∞) of E-3174, a more active metabolite of losartan, in 
      CYP2C9*3/*3 subjects was only 12% of that in CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. CONCLUSION: 
      The results confirmed the frequencies of CYP2C9 genotypes in a large cohort of 
      Koreans, and detected the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. CYP2C9*3/*3 subjects metabolized 
      much less losartan into E-3174 than CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects.

TI  - Effects of licochalcon A on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active 
      metabolite, EXP-3174, in rats.
PG  - 882-8
AB  - Losartan and licochalcon A interact with cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and the increase in the use of health supplements may 
      result in licochalcon A being taken concomitantly with losartan to treat or 
      prevent cardiovascular diseases as a combination therapy. The effect of 
      licochalcon A, a natural flavonoid, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite, EXP-3174, was investigated in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      of losartan and EXP-3174 were determined after oral administration of losartan (9 
      mg/kg) to rats in the presence or absence of licochalcon A (0.5, 2.5 and 10 
      mg/kg). The effect of licochalcon A on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as well as CYP3A4 
      and 2C9 activities was also evaluated. Licochalcon A inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 
      enzyme activities with 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) of 2.0 and 0.1 
      microM, respectively. In addition, licochalcon A significantly enhanced the 
      cellular accumulation of rhodamine-123 in a concentration-dependent manner in 
      MCF-7/ADR cells overexpressing P-gp. The pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan 
      were significantly altered by licochalcon A. Licochalcon A (2.5 mg/kg or 10 
      mg/kg) increased AUC0-infinity of losartan by 33.4-63.2% and Cmax of losartan by 
      34.0-62.8%. The total body clearance (CL/F) was significantly decreased (2.5 
      mg/kg, p < 0.05; 10 mg/kg, p < 0.01) by licochalcon A. Consequently, the absolute 
      bioavailability of losartan in the presence of licochalcon A increased 
      significantly (2.5 mg/kg, p < 0.05; 10 mg/kg, p < 0.01) compared to that in the 
      control group. The relative bioavailability (R.B.) of losartan was 1.15- to 
      1.63-fold greater than that of the control group. However, there was no 
      significant change in Tmax and t1/2 of losartan in the presence of licochalcon A. 
      Licochalcon A (10 mg/kg) increased the AUC0-infinity of EXP-3174 but this was not 
      significant. Furthermore, concurrent use of licochalcon A (10 mg/kg) 
      significantly decreased the metabolite-parent AUC ratio (M.R.) by 20%, suggesting 
      that licochalcon A inhibited the CYP-mediated metabolism of losartan to its 
      active metabolite, EXP-3174. In conclusion, the enhanced oral bioavailability of 
      losartan in the presence of licochalcon A may mainly result from decreased 
      P-gp-mediated efflux transporter in the small intestine and from the inhibition 
      of CYP 3A- and CYP2C9-mediated metabolism in the small intestine and liver and/or 
      from the reduction of total body clearance of losartan by licochalcon A.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of CYP2C9*1/*3 and *1/*13 genotypes were evaluated on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, in Korean 
      subjects. METHODS: Losartan (50 mg) was administered in 43 Korean volunteers with 
      different CYP2C9 genotypes (CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*3 and *1/*13). Losartan and E-3174 
      levels in the plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC using fluorescence. RESULTS: 
      The CYP2C9*1/*13 subjects showed lower oral clearance (p < 0.001) and greater 
      AUC0-∞ (p < 0.01) of losartan and higher Cmax (p < 0.01) and longer half-life (p 
      < 0.001) of E-3174 than the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects, but AUC0-∞ of E-3174 was not 
      different. The CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects showed lower oral clearance (p < 0.001) of 
      losartan and higher Cmax (p < 0.01) and longer half-life (p < 0.01) of E-3174 
      than the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. However, AUC0-∞ of losartan was greater in 
      CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects than in CYP2C9*1/*1, but these results were not significant 
      (p < 0.05, but statistical power < 0.8). In addition, AUC0-∞ of E-3174 was not 
      different. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters 
      between the CYP2C9*1/*13 and CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects. CONCLUSION: These results 
      suggest that CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP2C9*1/*13 are similarly associated with decreased 
      formation of E-3174 from losartan, but the clinical effects of losartan may not 
      be reduced by CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP2C9*1/*13.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare the 
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination product 
      (FDCP) comprising four different drugs (two antihypertensive drugs, amlodipine 
      and losartan, and two lipid-lowering agents, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin) with 
      their separate tablets. METHODS: A total of 60 participants were enrolled in this 
      open-label, randomized, single-dose crossover study. Each participant received a 
      single dose of FDCP and individual tablets during each period, with a 14-day 
      washout period between the periods. The pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine, 
      losartan, EXP3174 (an active metabolite of losartan), rosuvastatin, free 
      ezetimibe, and total ezetimibe were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: The 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of amlodipine, losartan, rosuvastatin, and ezetimibe 
      after administration of the individual products were similar to those of FDCP. 
      The geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals for maximum concentration 
      (C(max)) and area under the curve (AUC) of FDCP to individual tablets were within 
      0.8-1.25 for all six analytes. No clinically relevant changes were observed in 
      the vital signs or physical, biochemical, hematological, electrocardiographic, or 
      urinalysis findings during the study, and no serious adverse events were 
      reported. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a newly developed FDCP 
      containing amlodipine, losartan, ezetimibe, and rosuvastatin exhibited 
      pharmacokinetic equivalence with the individual products and met the regulatory 
      criteria. Both formulations were well tolerated. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      This trial (NCT04322266) was retrospectively registered on 9 September 2019.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and haemodynamic interactions between amlodipine and losartan in 
      human beings.
PG  - 345-352
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13244 [doi]
AB  - The combination of calcium channel blockers (CCB) and angiotensin receptor 
      blockers (ARB) for the treatment of hypertension showed improved efficacy and 
      safety. Amlodipine is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, whereas 
      losartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The potential pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between amlodipine and losartan were assessed. An open-label, 
      three-period, fixed-sequence trial was conducted. Amlodipine, losartan and 
      combined amlodipine and losartan were administered to 24 healthy male 
      participants during periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively, for 9 days each. The 
      pharmacokinetics of amlodipine, losartan and EXP-3174, an active metabolite of 
      losartan, were assessed at steady-state. Twenty participants completed the study 
      without serious adverse events. Losartan did not influence the exposure of 
      amlodipine at steady-state (AUC(τ) , 165.15 ng h/mL [amlodipine alone] vs 
      172.36 ng h/mL [combination], P = 0.389) [geometric mean ratio (GMR) (90% 
      confidence interval [CI]), 1.060 (0.954-1.178)]. In addition, the exposure of 
      EXP-3174 was not affected by amlodipine (AUC(τ) , 1159.46 ng h/mL vs 
      1105.10 ng h/mL, P = 0.295) (GMR [90% CI], 0.957 [0.891-1.027]). However, 
      amlodipine significantly decreased the exposure of losartan at steady-state 
      (AUC(τ) , 1241.50 ng h/mL vs 1082.02 ng h/mL, P = 0.006) (GMR [90% CI], 0.875 
      [0.813-0.942]) and increased oral clearance of losartan (84.65 L/h vs 97.26 L/h, 
      P = 0.002). Combination use of two drugs caused additive haemodynamic changes 
      compared to treatment of amlodipine or losartan alone. The co-administration of 
      amlodipine and losartan was tolerable and did not cause substantial 
      pharmacokinetic interaction, even though losartan disposition was affected. 
      Combination use of the two drugs caused additive haemodynamic changes compared to 
      monotherapy of amlodipine or losartan.

TI  - Candesartan, losartan and valsartan Zn(II) complexes interactions with bovine 
      serum albumin.
PG  - 9-16
LID - 10.4155/fmc-2021-0216 [doi]
AB  - Background: The pharmacological response and the therapeutic efficacy of a drug 
      depends on the interactions with plasma proteins. Methodology: The interaction of 
      bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the metal complexes of antihypertensive drugs, 
      Zn(II)/sartan complexes (candesartan, valsartan and losartan), was investigated 
      using fluorescence quenching determinations at different temperatures. Results: 
      The binding studies of the compounds with BSA showed static quenching and 
      moderate binding with calculated constants in the range of 10(4)-10(6) M(-1), 
      indicating potent serum distribution via albumins. In all cases, negative values 
      of free energy are indicative of spontaneous processes and the stabilization 
      of BSA/compound complexes through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. The 
      results for the sartans agree with the reported pharmacokinetics studies. 
      Conclusion: It has been determined that the three sartans and the Zn complexes 
      could be transported and distributed by albumin.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite, EXP3174, after intravenous and 
      oral administration of losartan to rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 147-58
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, EXP3174, were 
      investigated after intravenous and oral administration of the drug, 5 mg/kg, to 
      control rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus rats (SIDRs). After 
      1-min intravenous infusion, the mean arterial plasma concentrations and the 
      resultant area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity 
      (AUC) of both losartan and EXP3174 were not significantly different between 
      control rats and the SIDRs. However, the renal clearance (CLR) of losartan (0.181 
      versus 0.0815 ml/min/kg) and EXP3174 (0.0677 versus 0.0277 ml/min/kg) were 
      significantly faster in SIDRs than in control rats due to significant increase in 
      glomerular filtration rate. After oral administration, the mean arterial plasma 
      concentrations and the resultant AUC of losartan (97 versus 166 micrograms 
      min/ml) and EXP3174 (244 versus 423 micrograms min/ml) were significantly lower 
      in SIDRs than in control rats. The absolute extent of oral bioavailability of 
      losartan, F, (32.5 versus 55.1%) decreased considerably in SIDRs and it was 
      possibly due to the reduced gastrointestinal absorption of losartan by 
      gastrointestinal disorders occurring in the diabetic state. The low F in both 
      groups of rats was at least partially due to the increase in first-pass effects. 
      The CLR of losartan (0.207 versus 0.101 ml/min/kg) and EXP3174 (0.0615 versus 
      0.0196 ml/min/kg) were significantly faster in SIDRs than in control rats after 
      oral administration of losartan.

TI  - Effect of silymarin on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite 
      E-3174 in healthy Chinese volunteers.
PG  - 585-91
LID - 10.1007/s00228-009-0624-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of silymarin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan and its active metabolite E-3174 and its relationship with CYP2C9 
      genotypes. METHODS: Twelve healthy adult men of known CYP2C9 genotype (six 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 and six CYP2C9*1/*3) were recruited in a two-phase randomized 
      crossover design study. The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 were measured 
      before and after a 14-day treatment with 140 mg of silymarin three times daily. 
      RESULTS: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of losartan 
      increased significantly following a 14-day silymarin treatment in subjects with 
      the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, but not in those with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype. The AUC 
      of E-3174 decreased significantly with a silymarin pretreatment in both 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 and the CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects. The metabolic ratio of losartan (ratio 
      of AUC(0-infinity) of E-3174 to AUC(0-infinity) of losartan) decreased 
      significantly after a 14-day treatment with silymarin in individuals with the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (p < 0.05), but not in those with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype 
      (p = 0.065). CONCLUSION: Silymarin inhibits the metabolism of losartan to E-3174, 
      with the magnitude of the interaction differing in individuals with different 
      CYP2C9 genotypes.

AB  - We aim to identify the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      amlodipine, losartan and losartan's active metabolite (EXP3174) after oral 
      administration of the Compound Amlodipine Tablets with single dose in healthy 
      Chinese subjects. 12 subjects took the compounds (10 mg/100 mg, 
      amlodipine/losartan) at the conditions of a high-fat breakfast and an overnight 
      fast with a washout period of 14 days. Plasma samples were obtained at scheduled 
      time, and determined by HPLC-MS/MS for the concentrations of amlodipine and 
      HPLC-MS for the concentrations of losartan and EXP3174, respectively. PK 
      parameters were calculated using Software Drug and Statistics (Version 2.0). When 
      tablets were co-administered with food, there was no significant difference of 
      AUC for amlodipine and losartan, but the AUC of EXP3174 was reduced by 19.1%. 
      Meanwhile, the Cmax of amlodipine, losartan and EXP3174 were reduced by 11.4%, 
      20.0% and 41.4%, and the Tmax of losartan and EXP3174 were 1.3 and 1.8 h longer, 
      respectively. No significant difference was found at t1/2 following food intake. 
      In conclusion, the Compound Amlodipine Tablets, are affected by food 
      administration by reducing the AUC of EXP3174. It is thus suggested that the 
      Compound Amlodipine Tablets should be administered 1 h before or 2 h after meal.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence evaluation of two losartan potassium 50-mg 
      tablets: A single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-way crossover study 
      in healthy Chinese male volunteers.
PG  - 1387-95
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.06.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist used as 
      an antihypertensive agent. The relative bioavailability of a newly developed 
      tablet compared with an established branded formulation has not been reported in 
      a Chinese population. OBJECTIVE: To meet the requirements for marketing a new 
      generic product, the study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters 
      and relative bioavailability of a new generic losartan potassium 50-mg tablet 
      (test formulation) with a branded 50-mg tablet (reference formulation) in healthy 
      Chinese male volunteers. METHODS: A single-dose, randomized-sequence, openlabel, 
      2-way crossover study was conducted in healthy Chinese male volunteers. Eligible 
      participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 50-mg 
      tablet of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 1-week washout period 
      and then administration of the alternate formulation. The study drugs were 
      administered after a 10-hour overnight fast. Plasma samples were collected over 
      36 hours. Tolerability was evaluated by recording adverse events (AEs) and 
      monitoring vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory tests at baseline and at completion 
      of the study. Plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite 
      (EXP3174) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including 
      C(max), AUC(0-36), and AUC(0-infinity), were calculated. If the 90% CIs for the 
      log-transformed values of AUC were within 80% to 125%, and that of C(max) was 
      within 70% to 143%, the 2 products would be considered bioequivalent according to 
      the guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration and the State Food and Drug 
      Administration of China. RESULTS: Twenty-seven healthy Chinese male volunteers 
      participated in this study (mean [SD] age, 24.5 [2.3] years [range, 20-29 years]; 
      weight, 64.6 [4.0] kg [range, 60.0-75.0 kg]; height, 172.2 [4.8] cm [range, 
      165.0183.0 cm]; and body mass index, 21.8 [1.2] kg/m(2) [range, 20.0-25.0 
      kg/m(2)]). One volunteer (3.7%) experienced an AE (microscopic hematuria) after 
      administration of the test formulation. This resolved spontaneously after 10 days 
      and was considered by the investigator as mild; the relationship with the study 
      drug was uncertain. No serious AEs were reported. Both formulations were 
      associated with significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      and significant increases in heart rate compared with baseline values (all, P < 
      0.05). No period, formulation, or sequence effects were observed for any 
      pharmacokinetic parameter, except for a significant subject effect. For parent 
      losartan, the 90% CIs for the ratios (test/reference) of C(max), AUC(0-36), and 
      AUCAUC(0-infinity) were 83.65% to 113.36%, 89.79% to 98.25%, and 90.95% to 
      99.55%, respectively. For the metabolite EXP3174, the 90% CIs for the ratios of 
      C(max), AUC(0-36), and AUCAUC(0-infinity) were 93.49% to 103.61%, 96.79% to 
      104.09%, and 97.06% to 105.83%. Both C(max) and AUC met the predetermined 
      criteria for assuming bioequivalence. The relative bioavailability of the test 
      formulation to the reference formulation was 93.92% for losartan and 100.40% for 
      EXP3174. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in healthy Chinese male volunteers, a 
      single 50-mg oral dose of a losartan potassium tablet (test formulation) met the 
      regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to the established reference 
      formulation. Both formulations were well tolerated.

PG  - 525-32
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of a selective AT1-subtype, nonpeptide, orally active, 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, were characterized in 11 patients 
      with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II, n = 6; class III, n = 4; 
      class IV, n = 1) after oral and intravenous administration. In these patients, 
      average plasma clearance of losartan was 566 mL/min, volume of distribution at 
      steady-state was 34 L, and terminal plasma half-life was 1.5 hours. Average 
      bioavailability was 36%. No clinically significant accumulation of losartan or 
      its active metabolite, EXP3174, occurred after multiple-dose oral administration 
      for 7 to 8 days. Terminal plasma half-life of EXP3174 after oral administration 
      of losartan was 7.6 hours. The pharmacokinetics of losartan in patients in this 
      study appear to be similar to those in healthy subjects studied previously.

PG  - 641-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan potassium 
      and its active carboxylic acid metabolite EXP3174 were characterized in 18 
      healthy male subjects after administration of intravenous losartan, intravenous 
      EXP3174, and oral losartan. In these subjects, the average plasma clearance of 
      losartan was 610 ml/min, and the volume of distribution was 34 L. Renal clearance 
      (70 ml/min) accounted for 12% of plasma clearance. Terminal half-life was 2.1 
      hours. In contrast, the average plasma clearance of EXP3174 was 47 ml/min, and 
      its volume of distribution was 10 L. Renal clearance was 26 ml/min, which 
      accounted for 55% of plasma clearance; terminal half-life was 6.3 hours. After 
      oral administration of losartan, peak concentrations of losartan were reached in 
      1 hour. Peak concentrations of EXP3174 were reached in 3 1/2 hours. The area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve of EXP3174 was about four times that of 
      losartan. The oral bioavailability of losartan tablets was 33%. The low 
      bioavailability was mainly attributable to first-pass metabolism. After 
      intravenous or oral administration of losartan the conversion of losartan to the 
      metabolite EXP3174 was 14%.

TI  - Effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of eprosartan and losartan in 
      healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 417-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of steady-state fluconazole administration 
      on the disposition of eprosartan, losartan, and E-3174. METHODS: Sixteen healthy 
      male subjects received 300 mg eprosartan every 12 hours, and 16 received 100 mg 
      losartan every 24 hours on study days 1 to 20. All 32 subjects received 200 mg 
      fluconazole every 24 hours beginning on day 11 and continuing through day 20. 
      Serial blood samples were collected over one dosing interval on study days 10 and 
      20 for measurement of plasma concentrations of eprosartan, losartan, and E-3174 
      (the active metabolite of losartan). RESULTS: There was no significant difference 
      in eprosartan area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of last 
      quantifiable concentration [AUC(0-t)] or maximum concentration (Cmax) when 
      administered alone and with fluconazole. After concomitant administration with 
      fluconazole, losartan AUC(0-t) and Cmax were significantly increased 66% and 30%, 
      respectively, compared with those values for losartan alone. The AUC(0-t) and 
      Cmax for E-3174 were significantly decreased 43% and 56%, respectively, after 
      administration of losartan with fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole 
      significantly increases the steady-state AUC of losartan and inhibits the 
      formation of the active metabolite of losartan, E-3174. In contrast, fluconazole 
      administration has no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of eprosartan.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics and plasma concentration-effect relationship for the 
      nonpeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist losartan potassium 
      (losartan) have been determined with conscious and anesthetized dogs. The p.o. 
      bioavailability of single doses of 5 to 20 mg/kg was low, 23 to 33%, and 
      independent of the dose. Absorption was rapid, with peak plasma levels observed 
      within 1 hr, and the Cmax and area under the concentration vs. time curve to 
      infinity were proportional to the dose, P < .05. The elimination half-life, 108 
      to 153 min, was longer than that observed after a single i.v. dose, 41 min, and 
      may reflect both continuous absorption and enterohepatic recirculation because 
      the major route of excretion was via the bile. Single i.v. doses were eliminated 
      rapidly, with a systemic plasma clearance of 22.2 ml/min/kg. When corrected for 
      the blood:plasma distribution ratio, 0.66 to 0.72, the systemic clearance 
      approximates hepatic blood flow, suggesting that clearance is primarily via 
      hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. Losartan was not distributed 
      extensively to tissues; apparent volume of distribution at steady-state of 0.30 
      liters/kg and was highly but not extensively bound to plasma proteins; 2.7 to 
      2.9% unbound (free). The plasma concentration vs. blockade of exogenous Ang 
      II-induced vasopressor response was also determined after a single 3-mg/kg i.v. 
      dose of losartan with a sigmoidal Emax model. Blockade of the pressor response 
      was rapid, 89% at 5 min, and declined to 11% at 240 min postdose. The 
      relationship between concentration and effect was highly significant (r = 0.922, 
      P < .01), with an IC50 (total) of 96 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Losartan (LST) is a common chemical drug used to treat high blood pressure and 
      reduce the risk of stroke in certain people with heart disease. Danshen, prepared 
      from the dried root and rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been widely 
      used for prevention and treatment of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
      diseases. There are more than 35 formulations containing Danshen indexed in the 
      2010 Chinese Pharmacopoeia, which are often combined with LST to treat 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the clinic. The effects of the two 
      major components of Danshen, salvianolic acid B (SA-B) and tanshinone IIA (Tan 
      IIA), on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite, EXP3174, in rats 
      were investigated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: LST, 
      LST+SA-B and LST+Tan IIA, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated 
      after oral administration of LST, LST+SA-B and LST+Tan IIA. It was found that 
      there are significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the 
      three groups: Cmax, t1/2, AUC, AUMC in the LST+SA-B group was smaller than those 
      in group LST, while larger in group LST+Tan IIA. Further, the effects of SA-B and 
      Tan IIA on the metabolism of losartan was also investigated using rat liver 
      microsomes in vitro. The results indicated that SA-B can induce the metabolism of 
      LST, while Tan IIA can inhibit the metabolism of LST in rat liver microsomes in 
      vitro by regulating activities of CYP450 enzymes. In addition, the effect of SA-B 
      and Tan IIA on CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 expression was studied in Chang liver cells by 
      western-blotting and Real-time PCR. It was concluded that the two components of 
      Danshen, SA-B and Tan IIA have different influences on the metabolism of LST: 
      SA-B can obviously speed up the metabolism of LST by inducing CYP3A4/CYP2C9 
      activities and expression, however, Tan IIA can slow down the metabolism of LST 
      by inhibiting CYP3A4/CYP2C9 activities.

TI  - Comparisons of the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of fixed-dose combinations 
      of amlodipine besylate/losartan and amlodipine camsylate/losartan in healthy 
      subjects: a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence 
      crossover study.
PG  - 3021-3028
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of amlodipine and losartan has been 
      used to reduce blood pressure in patients whose hypertension is not sufficiently 
      controlled with either drug alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and tolerability of an FDC of 6.94 mg 
      amlodipine besylate (5 mg as amlodipine)/50 mg losartan potassium compared to an 
      FDC of 5 mg amlodipine camsylate/50 mg losartan potassium in healthy subjects. 
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, 
      two-sequence crossover study was conducted on 46 healthy male subjects. Blood 
      concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      Blood samples were collected up to 144 hours post dose for each period. PK 
      parameters were calculated in each treatment group using a noncompartmental 
      method. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of the 
      two treatments for the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under 
      the concentration curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point 
      (AUC(0-t)) were estimated. Tolerability assessments were performed for all 
      subjects who received the drug at least once. RESULTS: The PK profiles of the two 
      treatments were similar. For amlodipine, the geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of 
      amlodipine besylate to amlodipine camsylate for the C(max) and AUC(0-t) were 0.98 
      (0.94-1.01) and 0.97 (0.93-1.01), respectively. The corresponding values for 
      losartan were 0.91 (0.81-1.02) and 1.05 (0.98-1.12), respectively. The incidence 
      of adverse events was not significantly different between the two treatments, and 
      both were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: An FDC of 6.94 mg amlodipine besylate (5 mg 
      as amlodipine)/50 mg losartan potassium produced similar results to an FDC of 5 
      mg amlodipine camsylate/50 mg losartan potassium treatment with respect to the PK 
      parameters of amlodipine and losartan based on C(max) and AUC(0-t) values. The 
      amlodipine besylate/losartan potassium combination was well tolerated by healthy 
      male subjects.

AB  - In order to develop pharmacokinetic model, a well-known multilayer feed-forward 
      algorithm back-propagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANN) was applied to the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan in rabbit. The plasma concentrations of losartan in 
      twelve rabbits, which were divided into two groups and given losartan 2 mg/kg by 
      intravenous (Iv) and intragastrical (Ig) administration, were determined by 
      LC-MS. The BP-ANN model included one input layer, hidden layers, and one output 
      layer was constructed and compared with curve estimation based on the 
      time-concentration data of losartan. The results showed the BP-ANN model had high 
      goodness of fit index and good coherence (R > 0.99) between forecasted 
      concentration and measured concentration both in Iv and Ig administration. The 
      residuals of each concentrations generated by BP-ANN model were all smaller than 
      Curve estimation. The pharmacokinetic result showed there was no significant 
      difference between measured and simulated pharmacokinetic parameters including 
      AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), MRT(0-t), MRT(0-∞), T1/2 V and Cmax (P > 0.05). In 
      conclusion, the BP-ANN model has remarkably accurate predictions ability, which 
      better than Curve estimation, and can be used as a utility tool in 
      pharmacokinetic experiment.

AB  - For the first time, we developed and validated a highly sensitive, selective and 
      rapid HPLC-ESI-MS-MS method for simultaneous quantification of metolazone (MET), 
      losartan (LOS) and its metabolite losartan carboxylic acid (LCA) in rat plasma. 
      After solid-phase extraction, the analytes and internal standard (irbesartan) 
      were extracted from 100 µL plasma sample on an Agilent Poroshell 120, EC-C18 (50 
      × 4.6 mm, i.d., 2.7 µm) column using 5 µL injection volume with a total run time 
      of 3 min. Acidified methanol/water mixture was used as a mobile phase. The parent 
      → product ion transitions for MET (m/z 366.0 → 258.9), LOS (m/z 423.2 → 207.0), 
      LCA (m/z 437.0 → 235.1) and IS (m/z 429.2 → 207.0) were monitored on a triple 
      quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in the multiple reaction monitoring and 
      positive ion mode. The method was found to be linear in the range of 0.05-250 for 
      MET, 2-3,000 for LOS and 4-3,500 ng/mL for LCA. The method was validated with 
      respect to selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery and stability 
      according to accepted regulatory guidelines. The described method was 
      successfully applied to preclinical pharmacokinetic studies of analytes after an 
      oral administration of mixture of MET (1 mg/kg) and LOS (10 mg/kg) in rats.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and blood pressure response of losartan in end-stage renal 
      disease.
PG  - 519-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is a selective angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist currently 
      employed in the management of essential hypertension. This compound is in common 
      use in populations with renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan 
      in patients with ESRD in order to establish administration guidelines. METHODS: 
      Patients were administered losartan 100 mg/day for 7 days, and after the seventh 
      and final dose pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for both losartan and 
      its active metabolite E-3174. During the study, the haemodialytic clearances of 
      losartan and E-3174 were measured during a standard 4-hour dialysis session. 
      Neurohumoral and biochemical changes were assessed during losartan 
      administration. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 in 
      haemodialysis patients did not alter to a clinically significant level. Losartan 
      administration was accompanied by a decline in plasma aldosterone level as well 
      as by an increase in plasma renin activity. Losartan administration resulted in a 
      decline in plasma uric acid level, despite the fact that the study participants 
      had no residual renal function. Losartan and E-3174 were not dialysable. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 are minimally altered in 
      ESRD; thus, dosage adjustment is not required in the presence of advanced 
      dialysis-dependent renal failure. In addition, postdialysis supplementation is 
      not required for losartan because of the negligible dialysability of losartan and 
      E-3174.

      peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 389-95
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan and its active metabolite, 
      E-3174, were studied in 8 stable, hypertensive continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) patients. Following a 1-week washout period, subjects received 
      100 mg of losartan orally for 7 days. On Days 1 and 7, hemodynamic and hormonal 
      responses were determined, as were PK parameters on Day 7. Peritoneal 
      equilibration testing was performed pre-Day 1 and on Day 7. AUC0-24 and t1/2 for 
      losartan and E-3174 were 95 +/- 49.9 micrograms.min/mL and 176 +/- 82.1 
      micrograms.min/mL and 172.5 +/- 86.7 minutes and 628 +/- 575 minutes, 
      respectively. These values are similar to those of normal subjects and subjects 
      on hemodialysis. Peritoneal clearance of losartan and E-3174 was negligible. All 
      subjects demonstrated a substantial reduction in blood pressure with at least a 
      10 mmHg drop in diastolic BP. Plasma renin activity (PRA) values increased, but 
      aldosterone, endothelin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine values did not change 
      following 7 days of losartan. Losartan was well tolerated in all study subjects.

TI  - Olmesartan medoxomil.
PG  - 1345-53; discussion 1354-6
AB  - Olmesartan medoxomil is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist which 
      selectively and competitively inhibits the type 1 angiotensin II receptor without 
      affecting other receptors regulating the cardiovascular system. In well designed 
      randomised trials, olmesartan medoxomil was significantly more effective than 
      placebo, and at dosages of 10 to 20 mg/day was at least as effective as atenolol 
      50 to 100 mg/day in reducing diastolic blood pressure (DBP). At dosages of 5 to 
      20 mg/day, olmesartan medoxomil was more effective than captopril 12.5 to 50mg 
      twice daily at lowering seated DBP in patients with mild to moderate hypertension 
      in a dose titration study. Reductions in seated DBP were greater with olmesartan 
      medoxomil 10 to 20 mg/day than losartan 50 to 100 mg/day. Olmesartan medoxomil at 
      20 mg/day was more effective in lowering seated DBP than losartan 50 mg/day, 
      valsartan 80 mg/day or irbesartan 150 mg/day, and was more efficacious than 
      losartan 50 mg/day or valsartan 80 mg/day at reducing 24-hour ambulatory systolic 
      blood pressure. Olmesartan medoxomil has shown no clinically important 
      pharmacokinetic interactions with digoxin, warfarin or antacid (aluminium 
      magnesium hydroxide). Adverse events were infrequent in clinical studies of 
      olmesartan medoxomil and were similar to those attributed to placebo. With 
      olmesartan medoxomil, the frequency of dizziness was higher than with placebo but 
      similar to that occurring with losartan, valsartan and irbesartan.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma by 
      LC/MS/MS with electrospray ionization and its application to pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 415-27
AB  - A method based on a simple liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography with negative ion electrospray ionization 
      tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection was developed for the 
      simultaneous determination of losartan (LOS) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 
      human plasma, using valsartan (VAL) and chlorthalidone (CHTD) as an internal 
      standard, respectively. The acquisition was performed in multiple reactions 
      monitoring (MRM) and the limit of quantification was 4 ng/mL for both LOS and 
      HCTZ. The method was linear in the studied range (4-800 ng/mL for LOS and 4-500 
      ng/mL for HCTZ). The intra-assay precisions ranged from 2.6-11.9% for LOS and 
      1.4-8.2% for HCTZ, while the inter-assay precisions ranged from 1.0-8.0% for LOS 
      and 2.5-7.7% for HCTZ. The intra-assay accuracies ranged from 91.3 to 107.6% for 
      LOS and 91.5 to 105.8% for HCTZ, while the inter-assay accuracies ranged from 
      99.9 to 106.4% for LOS and 97.4 to 101.4% for HCTZ. The analytical method was 
      applied to a bioequivalence study, in which 28 healthy adult volunteers (14 men) 
      received single oral doses (100 mg LOS + 25 mg HCTZ) of reference and test 
      formulations, in an open, two-period, balanced randomized, crossover protocol. 
      Based on the 90% confidence interval of the individual ratios for Cmax and 
      AUC0-inf, it was concluded that the test formulation is bioequivalent to the 
      reference Hyzaar formulation with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of 
      both LOS and HCTZ.

TI  - Influence of compound danshen tablet on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
PG  - 1219-24
LID - 10.1002/bmc.2930 [doi]
AB  - Losartan is an effective anti-hypotension drug frequently used in clinic. 
      Compound danshen tablet (CDST) is an important traditional Chinese multiherbal 
      formula composed of Danshen, Sanqi and Bingpian, which is widely used for the 
      treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China. More often, 
      losartan and CDST are simultaneously used for the treatment of anti-hypertension 
      in the clinic. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan and EXP3174 after oral administration of single losartan and both 
      losartan and CDST, and to investigate the influence of CDST on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite EXP3174. Male Sprague-Dawley rats 
      were randomly assigned to two groups: a losartan-only group and a losartan and 
      CDST group. Plasma concentrations of losartan and EXP3174 were determined by 
      LC-MS at designated points after drug administration, and the main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. It was found that there were 
      significant differences (p < 0.05) between the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      losartan and EXP3174, which showed that CDST influenced the metabolism and 
      excretion of losartan in vivo. The result could be used for clinical medication 
      guidance of losartan and CDST to avoid the occurrence of adverse reactions.

TI  - The effect of AST-120 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      losartan acid (E-3174) in healthy subjects.
PG  - 310-20
AB  - AST-120 is an orally administered adsorbent used to slow the progression of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). This was a randomized, open-label, 5-way crossover 
      study to assess the effect of AST-120 on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite (E-3174) in healthy subjects. Losartan (100 mg) was 
      administered alone under fasting (A) and fed (B) conditions, and results were 
      compared when AST-120 (3 g thrice daily for 2 days) was administered 60 minutes 
      after (C), 30 minutes prior to (D), and 30 minutes after (E) losartan. Plasma 
      concentrations of losartan and E-3174 were assayed by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Under fed conditions, treatment 
      C had no significant effect on the AUC(0-t) and Cmax of losartan and E-3174. 
      Treatments D and E resulted in a marked decrease in Cmax of losartan and E-3174. 
      Therefore, administration of AST-120 60 minutes after losartan under fed 
      conditions may be preferred over other dosing regimens for CKD patients.

TI  - Formulation and Characterization of Losartan Loaded Chitosan Microspheres: Effect 
      of Crosslinking Agents.
PG  - 204-212
LID - 10.1055/a-1324-2466 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present investigation entailed determination of effect of diverse 
      cross-linking agents on Losartan Potassium loaded chitosan microspheres. The 
      emulsion cross-linking method was employed to formulate the microspheres with an 
      endeavour to achieve maximum sustained effect. METHODS: The FTIR studies revealed 
      absence of any interaction between Losartan and chitosan. The emulsion cross 
      linking method was accomplished in three steps encompassing formation of an 
      aqueous and oily phase, emulsification and cross-linking. A total of eighteen 
      Losartan formulations were developed using six different cross-linkers at three 
      varying level were screened for optimum parameters. The in vitro drug release 
      parameters of optimum formulations (LC3, LE3, LF3, LG3, LS3 and LV3) containing 
      citric acid, epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, suphuric acid and 
      vanillin as cross-linkers were assessed to determine the sustained effect. 
      RESULTS: The values of evaluated parameters including percent yield (94.67%), 
      average particle size (51.19 µm), drug content (44.38 mg) and entrapment 
      efficiency (88.77%) connoted LG3 as the best formulation. Additionally, the 
      values of relative measure of skewness (β(1)=0.01 and γ(1)=0.10) and platykurtic 
      (β(2)=1.26) size distribution were least for LG3 with spherical shape and smooth 
      surface as revealed by SEM studies. CONCLUSION: The outcome of in vitro release 
      and other characterizations of microspheres explicitly revealed glutaraldehyde as 
      the best cross-linker amongst the cross-linkers used herewith. The maximum 
      sustained effect (lasting over a period of 24 h) accompanied with higher MDT and 
      t(50%) with lower%DE and Q(14h) values thus corroborated the objective of 
      attaining sustained release of Losartan.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is one of the major 
      therapeutic strategies in the management of patients with essential hypertension, 
      congestive heart failure and diabetic as well as non-diabetic renal diseases. As 
      the first angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) on the market, losartan belongs 
      to the most frequently prescribed ARB. AREA COVERED: The present review examines 
      the pharmacokinetics of losartan with a special discussion on the dose of 
      losartan that should be used in clinical practice to obtain the maximal benefits 
      of the drug. Readers are provided with arguments suggesting that the dose of 50 
      mg losartan is probably too low and that losartan should preferably be prescribed 
      at the dose of 100 mg/day or higher. EXPERT OPINION: Losartan is an effective 
      antagonist of angiotensin II AT(1) receptors which has been shown to provide 
      important clinical benefits in patients with hypertension, congestive heart 
      failure and renal diseases. Losartan should be prescribed at the dose of 100 
      mg/day and the use of higher doses should be reconsidered in future studies to 
      improve its clinical efficacy.

TI  - Combination of losartan and puerarin induced pharmacokinetic interaction in 
      hypertension rats enhances the antihypertensive effect of losartan.
PG  - 201-206
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2023.2207639 [doi]
AB  - The co-administration of losartan and puerarin in hypertension rat models was 
      investigated aiming to evaluate their interaction and potential 
      mechanism.Hypertension rat models were established with N 
      (omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and the pharmacokinetics and 
      antihypertensive effect of losartan were analyzed in normal and hypertension 
      rats. In vitro, the metabolic stability of losartan was evaluated in rat liver 
      microsomes, and the effect of puerarin on the activity of CYP2C9 and 3A4 was 
      assessed in human liver microsomes.Puerarin significantly changed the 
      pharmacokinetic profiling of losartan in hypertension rats, with the behaviour of 
      increasing AUC, AUMC, C(max), and prolonged t(1/2). The antihypertensive effect 
      of losartan was enhanced by the co-administration of puerarin, which reduced the 
      systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure below normal levels. In 
      vitro, puerarin significantly improved the metabolic stability of losartan with a 
      reduced intrinsic clearance rate. Puerarin also showed significant inhibitory 
      effects on the activity of CYP2C9 and 3A4 with the IC(50) of 17.15 and 7.69 μM, 
      respectively.Losartan co-administered with puerarin increased the system exposure 
      and metabolic stability of losartan and enhanced its antihypertensive effect. The 
      inhibition of CYP2C9 and 3A4 by puerarin was the potential mechanism mediating 
      their interaction.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of losartan with 
      glimepiride-metformin combination in rats and rabbits.
PG  - 465-470
LID - 10.4103/ijp.IJP_845_19 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The presence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, 
      peripheral vascular disease, and chronic renal disease, or and the prevention of 
      these ailments in diabetics, frequently demands multiple drug treatments, 
      increasing the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The current study was 
      focused on identifying possible DDIs on concomitant administration of losartan, a 
      drug used to regulate hypertension along with a combination of glimepiride + 
      metformin, widely used to treat diabetes mellitus. Possible pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic interactions were observed for, following single-dose as well as 
      multiple-dose treatment protocols in normal and alloxan-induced diabetes in 
      albino Wistar rats and rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 
      surviving rats/rabbits obtained through orbital venous sinus bleeding/marginal 
      ear vein bleeding, respectively, at predetermined intervals and put through to 
      biochemical estimations of sugar level in the blood by Glucose oxidase/peroxidase 
      method; insulin levels in serum using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 
      serum glimepiride levels using the high-performance liquid chromatography. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Losartan, when treated as a single drug, resulted in a 
      slight lowering of blood glucose levels in normal rats, diabetic rats and normal 
      rabbits. Hypoglycemic activity of a combination of glimepiride + metformin was 
      enhanced when losartan was co-administered as a single dosage schedule as well as 
      a multiple dose schedule as indicated by a reduced blood glucose level and 
      enhanced levels of insulin in rats as well as in rabbits. Serum glimepiride 
      levels were also higher and pharmacokinetic parameters of glimepiride including 
      mean residence time, C(max), T(1/2), AUMC(0-∞), AUMC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞), were 
      significantly higher, whereas its clearance was decreased in the two regimens of 
      losartan that was followed. CONCLUSION: It can therefore be concluded, that in 
      diabetics with hypertension as a comorbidity condition, co-administration of 
      losartan with glimepiride + metformin should be avoided or the dosage of a 
      combination of glimepiride + metformin needs to be tittered to avoid recurrence 
      of hypoglycemic episodes.

TI  - Telmisartan.
PG  - 1039-44; discussion 1045-6
AB  - Telmisartan is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist which selectively 
      and insurmountably inhibits the angiotensin II AT1 receptor subtype without 
      affecting other receptor systems involved in cardiovascular regulation. Oral 
      telmisartan dose-dependently reduced blood pressure (BP) in various animal models 
      of hypertension. In transgenic rats, telmisartan reduced cardiac hypertrophy and 
      glomerulosclerosis. When administered at dosages of 40 to 160 mg once daily to 
      patients with mild to moderate hypertension, telmisartan significantly reduced 
      systolic and diastolic BP compared with placebo and was at least as effective as 
      atenolol 50 or 100 mg and lisinopril 10 to 40 mg. One study showed telmisartan 80 
      mg/day to be more effective than enalapril 20 mg/day. In 2 studies that used 
      ambulatory BP monitoring, once daily telmisartan provided better control of 
      diastolic BP for the full dosing interval than losartan potassium 50 mg or 
      amlodipine 5 or 10 mg. In a single study in patients with severe hypertension, a 
      telmisartan-based regimen had antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of an 
      enalapril-based regimen. Telmisartan had a tolerability profile similar to that 
      of placebo in clinical studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, safety, and antihypertensive efficacy of losartan in 
      combination with hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with renal 
      impairment.
PG  - 591-603
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 7 days of treatment with losartan 50 
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were evaluated in 14 patients with normal renal 
      function and in 12 patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The efficacy 
      of losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg titrated to losartan 100 
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg was examined in 32 hypertensive patients with mild 
      to moderate renal impairment who were treated for 12 weeks. Safety was assessed 
      in both studies by the incidence of adverse experiences. After 7 days of 
      treatment, the AUC for losartan, E-3174, and hydrochlorothiazide was slightly 
      higher in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, but the reduction in 
      blood pressure (BP) after 7 days was not different between the two groups. The 
      final (week 12) mean reductions in trough sitting diastolic and systolic BP were 
      15.0 +/- 7.1 mmHg (p < 0.01) and 20.8 +/- 16.7 mmHg (p < 0.01), respectively. 
      There were no observed increases in drug-related adverse experiences in either 
      study. Overall, the combination of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide was effective in 
      lowering blood pressure and was well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate 
      renal impairment.

      EXP3174 by CYP2C9. In this study, we determined the effects of the single 
      CYP2C9*3 variant on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan. 
      METHODS: Seven healthy Japanese subjects ( CYP2C9*1/*1, n=4 and CYP2C9*1/*3, n=3) 
      were phenotyped with a single dose of losartan (25 mg). Blood and urine samples 
      were collected and assayed for losartan and EXP3174. Blood pressure and pulse 
      rate were also measured using a sphygmomanometer. RESULTS: The maximum plasma 
      concentration of EXP3174 was significantly (P<0.05) lower in the CYP2C9*1/*3 
      (n=3) group than in the CYP2C9*1/*1 (n=4) group. Diastolic blood pressure in the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 group, but not that in the CYP2C9*1/*3 group except for at 6 h and 8 
      h, was reduced from 1.5 h to 12 h compared with the baseline level. Systolic 
      blood pressure in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group, but not that in the CYP2C9*1/*3 group, 
      was reduced from 1 h to 12 h compared with the baseline level. The metabolic 
      ratio (MR) of EXP3174 concentration to the losartan concentration in plasma at 6 
      h post-dosing and the 4-h to 8-h urinary EXP3174/losartan MR were significantly 
      lower in the CYP2C9*1/*3 group than in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The plasma 6-h MR 
      and the 4-h to 8-h urinary MR were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with the 
      plasma AUC ratio (AUC(EXP3174)/AUC(losartan)), with Spearman rank correlation 
      coefficients of 0.75 and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSION: The single CYP2C9*3 
      variant reduces the metabolism of losartan and its hypotensive effect. Plasma MR, 
      as well as urine MR, may be useful for phenotyping assays of CYP2C9 activity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and biochemical efficacy after single and multiple oral 
      administration of losartan, an orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, in humans.
PG  - 290-7
AB  - 1. The pharmacokinetics and biochemical efficacy of losartan, an orally active 
      nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, were evaluated in healthy 
      male volunteers after single and multiple oral administration. 2. Plasma and 
      urinary concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, were 
      determined by a specific high performance liquid chromatographic (h.p.l.c.) 
      method. 3. Plasma concentrations of losartan were proportional to dose over the 
      range of 25 to 200 mg and the terminal half-lives (t1/2,z) ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 
      h. The mean values of Cmax and AUC0-infinity increased in a dose-dependent 
      manner. 4. Plasma concentrations of E-3174 were higher than those of losartan at 
      all dose levels. The values of Cmax and AUC0-infinity for E-3174 were 
      approximately 2 and 5-8 times higher than those for losartan, respectively. Also 
      the value of t1/2,z was 2 times longer than that of losartan. 5. After multiple 
      dosing for 7 days, the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174 each did not 
      change significantly between day 1 and day 7. 6. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and 
      plasma concentrations of AII increased markedly at all dose levels. Plasma 
      aldosterone levels were slightly reduced, but a similar decrease was also 
      observed with placebo. 7. No clinically significant adverse reaction was observed 
      in any of the volunteers during either study. Blood counts, routine laboratory 
      tests, urine analyses, and electrocardiograms were also not modified by losartan. 
      8. Losartan appears to be a potent orally active angiotensin II antagonist with a 
      relatively long duration of action.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics and biochemical efficacy of losartan, an orally active 
      nonpeptide angiotensin II (A II)-receptor antagonist, were studied in healthy 
      male volunteers after single oral dose administration (25, 50, 100, or 200 mg) 
      and multiple oral dose administration (100 mg or placebo once a day for 7 days). 
      Plasma and urinary concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, 
      were determined. The mean Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) values increased in 
      a dose-dependent manner. The terminal half-life of losartan ranged from 1.5 to 
      2.5 hours. Plasma concentration of E-3174 was higher than that of losartan at all 
      dose levels. The Cmax and AUC values for E-3174 were approximately two and five 
      to eight times higher than those for losartan, respectively. Furthermore, the 
      half-life of E-3174 was two times that of losartan. After multiple dosing for 7 
      days, the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174 did not change significantly 
      between day 1 and day 7. Plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of A II 
      increased at all dose levels. Plasma aldosterone levels were slightly reduced, 
      but a similar decrease was also observed with placebo. The urinary excretion of 
      uric acid within the first 4 hours after treatment was also increased in a 
      dose-dependent manner, whereas the urinary excretion of creatinine remained 
      unchanged. In other pharmacokinetic studies, it has been reported that 
      bioavailability of losartan is about 33%, and its absorption is excellent. The 
      metabolite is excreted via urine and the bile. Based on our observations, the 
      half-life and plasma concentrations of E-3174 were greater than those of 
      losartan. In conclusion, the long-lasting blocking effect of losartan on A II 
      action can be attributed to the plasma levels of its active metabolite, E-3174.

      by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

LID - 10.1159/000328773 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the effects of 
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors 
      (atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and 
      its active metabolite EXP-3174 in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan 
      and EXP-3174 in rats were determined after oral and intravenous administration of 
      losartan (9 mg/kg) without and with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (1 mg/kg). The 
      effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on P-gp and cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 activity 
      were also evaluated. Atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin inhibited CYP3A4 
      activities with IC₅₀ values of 48.0, 14.1 and 3.10 μmol/l, respectively. 
      Simvastatin (1-10 μmol/l) enhanced the cellular uptake of rhodamine-123 in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. The area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC₀₋∞) and the peak plasma concentration of losartan were significantly 
      (p < 0.05) increased by 59.6 and 45.8%, respectively, by simvastatin compared to 
      those of control. The total body clearance (CL/F) of losartan after oral 
      administration with simvastatin was significantly decreased (by 34.8%) compared 
      to that of controls. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (F) of losartan 
      after oral administration with simvastatin was significantly increased by 59.4% 
      compared to that of control. The metabolite-parent AUC ratio was significantly 
      decreased by 25.7%, suggesting that metabolism of losartan was inhibited by 
      simvastatin. In conclusion, the enhanced bioavailability of losartan might be 
      mainly due to inhibition of P-gp in the small intestine and CYP3A 
      subfamily-mediated metabolism of losartan in the small intestine and/or liver and 
      to reduction of the CL/F of losartan by simvastatin.

AB  - This study aims at investigating the potential effect of selected cationic drugs 
      (azithromycin (AZN) and pseudoephedrine sulfate (PSD) on the dissolution profile 
      and intestinal permeation of losartan potassium (LOS) that might occur due to ion 
      pair salt formation. DSC, FT-IR and (1)H NMR indicated the formation of ion pair 
      salts between LOS and each of AZN and PSD. Based on NMR chemical shifts 
      calculations, utilizing specialized software, the most likely structures of the 
      salt were proposed and revealed interesting structural features. The obtained ion 
      pair products were shown to have lower aqueous solubilities (water and phosphate 
      buffer pH 6.8) and higher apparent partition coefficient values compared to the 
      parent compound. Neither of the cations affected the dissolution of LOS tablet 
      (Cozaar® 100 mg) in the studied media (HCl pH 1.2 and phosphate buffer pH 6.8). 
      Interestingly, AZN significantly increased the dissolution of LOS in phosphate 
      buffer pH 4.5 (f(2) = 33), and an explanation based on distinguished association 
      pattern between AZN and LOS (CH/π) was offered. Employing permeation test across 
      Caco-2 cells monolayer, the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of LOS 
      increased significantly (from 0.9 × 10(-5) cm/s to 1.8 × 10(-5) cm/s) in the 
      presence of the selected cations. Therefore, while the employed cationic drugs 
      were not shown to form ion pair salts under the in-vitro dissolution conditions, 
      they may still participate in significant in-vivo interaction with LOS.

TI  - Effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active 
      metabolite E3174 in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 369-73
AB  - Grapefruit juice (GJ), a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, may affect the 
      pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized through CYP 3A4. Losartan, an angiotensin 
      II antagonist, is converted into its main active metabolite E3174 by CYP 3A4 and 
      CYP 2C9. The effect of GJ on losartan pharmacokinetics was assessed in a 
      randomized crossover trial. Losartan was given to 9 volunteers with and without 
      GJ. Concentrations of losartan and its E3174 metabolite were determined in serum 
      by a high-performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC). Significant 
      differences were observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan 
      and its metabolite E3174 after losartan administration with and without 
      co-administered GJ. The lag time (time to drug appearance in serum) of losartan 
      increased significantly with co-administered GJ. The mean residence time (MRT) 
      and half-life (t(1/2)) of the E3174 metabolite were significantly longer and the 
      area under the concentration--time curve (AUC) of the E3174 metabolite was 
      significantly smaller after concomitant GJ administration. The ratio 
      AUC(losartan)/AUC(E3174) was significantly increased after concurrent grapefruit 
      juice intake. The increased lag time of losartan and the increased MRT and t1/2 
      and decreased AUC of E3174 were considered indicative of simultaneous CYP 3A4 
      inhibition and P-glycoprotein activation. The significantly increased 
      AUC(losartan)/AUC(E3174) ratio, however, indicates reduced losartan conversion to 
      E3174 by CYP 3A4 metabolism as a result of co-administered GJ.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction of losartan and glimepiride in rats 
      and its possible mechanism.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1159/000377637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan and glimepiride are commonly used drugs to treat chronic 
      diseases of hypertension and diabetes; they are both substrates of CYP2C9. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interaction of losartan 
      and glimepiride both in vitro (rat liver microsomes) and in vivo (healthy 
      Sprague-Dawley rats). METHODS: In rat liver microsomes, 1-10 μmol/l losartan and 
      glimepiride were coincubated, and the inhibitory effect was analyzed. In the 
      subsequent pharmacokinetic study, 15 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats received 
      administrations of 5 mg/kg losartan or 1 mg/kg glimepiride or a coadministration. 
      RESULTS: In the rat liver microsome system, glimepiride showed a slight 
      inhibition of losartan at concentrations of 1-10 μmol/l, whereas losartan 
      exhibited no inhibitory effect on glimepiride. In vivo, glimepiride did not 
      modify the plasma concentration of losartan and its metabolite E-3174. The 
      alteration of an increased AUC and Cmax was observed in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of glimepiride and hydroxy glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride did 
      not affect losartan pharmacokinetics in rats, while losartan potently altered 
      glimepiride metabolism; this result was inconsistent with the in vitro outcome. 
      The mechanism requires further investigation. In clinical settings, attention 
      should be paid to the interaction of these two drugs in the human body as well as 
      the possible adverse reactions of glimepiride.

TI  - Losartan potassium: a review of its pharmacology, clinical efficacy and 
      tolerability in the management of hypertension.
PG  - 820-45
AB  - Losartan potassium is an orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor 
      antagonist. It is the first of a new class of drugs to be introduced for clinical 
      use in hypertension. This novel agent binds competitively and selectively to the 
      AII subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor, thereby blocking AII-induced physiological 
      effects. An active metabolite, E3174, contributes substantially to its 
      antihypertensive effect, which persists throughout 24 hours after once-daily 
      administration. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, losartan 
      potassium 50 to 100mg once daily as monotherapy lowers blood pressure to a 
      similar degree to enalapril, atenolol and felodipine extended release (ER). 
      Losartan potassium combined with hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure 
      further than either drug given separately. About one-third of patients with 
      severe hypertension have responded to the combination product. Losartan potassium 
      appears to be effective in elderly patients. Losartan potassium is very well 
      tolerated. In clinical trials, dizziness was the only drug-related event reported 
      more frequently with losartan potassium monotherapy than with placebo. First-dose 
      hypotension is uncommon. An aspect of the drug's tolerability profile which may 
      prove to be particularly advantageous is that it is associated with a similar 
      incidence of cough to placebo in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-related 
      cough. Additionally, clinically relevant adverse metabolic effects or laboratory 
      abnormalities have not been documented during losartan potassium therapy and 
      renal function is preserved in patients with or without renal insufficiency. The 
      adverse effect profile of the losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide combination 
      resembles those for losartan potassium monotherapy and placebo. Long term 
      tolerability data are limited (<2 years) but support the very good tolerability 
      profile in shorter studies. Elements of the drug's profile yet to be assessed or 
      reported fully in the literature include long term efficacy; potential to 
      favourably influence cardiovascular and renovascular systems (and ultimately 
      mortality) in patients with hypertension and, lastly, cost effectiveness and 
      influence on quality of life. In summary, losartan potassium is the first AT(1)+ 
      receptor antagonist to become available for the management of hypertension and, 
      as such, it is an important new antihypertensive agent. Pending long term data as 
      outlined above, it is likely to find initial use in patients with mild to severe 
      hypertension who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of their current therapy. 
      However, with its novel mechanism of action, good efficacy and favourable 
      tolerability profile, losartan potassium is well placed to claim a prominent 
      position in the management of patients with essential hypertension in the future.

TI  - Effects of myricetin, an antioxidant, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its 
      active metabolite, EXP-3174, in rats: possible role of cytochrome P450 3A4, 
      cytochrome P450 2C9 and P-glycoprotein inhibition by myricetin.
PG  - 908-14
LID - 10.1211/jpp.62.07.0012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effects of myricetin, a natural flavonoid, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite, EXP-3174, were 
      investigated in rats. Losartan and myricetin interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      enzymes and P-glycoprotein, and the increase in the use of health supplements may 
      result in myricetin being taken concomitantly with losartan as a combination 
      therapy to treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of losartan and EXP-3174 were determined after oral administration of 
      losartan (9 mg/kg) to rats in the presence or absence of myricetin (0.4, 2 and 8 
      mg/kg). The effects of myricetin on P-glycoprotein as well as CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 
      activity were also evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: Myricetin inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 
      enzyme activity with a 50% inhibition concentration of 7.8 and 13.5 microm, 
      respectively. In addition, myricetin significantly enhanced the cellular 
      accumulation of rhodamine 123 in MCF-7/ADR cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein in 
      a concentration-dependent manner. The pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan were 
      significantly altered by myricetin compared with the control. The presence of 
      myricetin (2 or 8 mg/kg) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve of losartan by 31.4-61.1% and peak plasma concentration of losartan by 
      31.8-50.2%. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability of losartan in the 
      presence of myricetin increased significantly (P < 0.05, 2 mg/kg; P < 0.01, 8 
      mg/kg) compared with the control. There was no significant change in the time to 
      reach the peak plasma concentration, apparent volume of distribution at steady 
      state or terminal half-life of losartan in the presence of myricetin. 
      Furthermore, concurrent use of myricetin (8 mg/kg) significantly decreased the 
      metabolite-parent area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio by 20%, 
      implying that myricetin may inhibit the CYP-mediated metabolism of losartan to 
      its active metabolite, EXP-3174. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced bioavailability of 
      losartan may be mainly due to inhibition of the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated 
      metabolism of losartan in the small intestine or in the liver, and the 
      P-glycoprotein efflux pump in the small intestine by myricetin.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic comparison and bioequivalence evaluation of losartan/ 
      hydrochlorothiazide tablet between Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers.
PG  - 39-54
LID - 10.5414/CP201927 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the bioequivalence between the test and reference 
      formulations of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 12.5 mg tablet and evaluate the 
      effect of ethnicity on pharmacokinetics properties of losartan, losartan 
      carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide on healthy Asian Indian and Japanese 
      volunteers. METHODS: Randomized, open-label, crossover, bioavailability studies 
      were conducted separately in healthy Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers. One 
      tablet either of test or of reference product was administered after 10 hours of 
      overnight fasting. After dosing, serial blood samples were collected for a period 
      of 48 hours for both the studies. Plasma samples were analyzed for losartan, 
      losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide by a validated liquid 
      chromatographic and mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic 
      parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, tmax, and other pharmacokinetics parameters were 
      determined from plasma concentration-time profiles for both test and reference 
      formulations of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 12.5 mg tablets. Statistical 
      evaluations were done to evaluate bioequivalence between generic test formulation 
      (EPR0001) and Japanese reference product (Preminent®). RESULTS: Losartan, 
      losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide were well tolerated by subjects 
      in all periods of each study under fasted conditions. No serious adverse events 
      were observed. The ratios of least square means for AUC0-t and Cmax and the 
      affiliated 90% confidence intervals were within acceptance range recommended by 
      PMDA. Marginal differences were observed in pharmacokinetic values of Asian 
      Indian and Japanese volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these bioavailability 
      studies indicate that the test formulation of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 
      12.5 mg (EPR0001) tablets is bioequivalent to marketed Preminent® reference 
      formulation in Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers, when administered under 
      fasting conditions. Both test and reference formulations were well tolerated as a 
      single oral dose when administered to healthy adult subjects under fasted 
      conditions. Although Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers are ethnically 
      different, results of these studies indicate that pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers are comparable to each other in terms of 
      bioavailability of losartan, losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide. 
      Similar least square means ratios were obtained in Asian Indian and Japanese 
      volunteers demonstrating that a bioequivalence study conducted on Japanese 
      volunteers seems to be substituted by Asian Indian volunteers' studies.

TI  - Effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa and Zingiber officinale on the antihypertensive 
      activity and pharmacokinetic of losartan in hypertensive rats.
PG  - 847-857
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2020.1729446 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to determine the effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa and 
      Zingiber officinale on antihypertensive activity and pharmacokinetic of losartan 
      in hypertensive rats.Hypertension was induced in rats by oral administration of 
      L-NAME (40 mg/kg per day). Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of losartan were 
      evaluated without and with herbal treatment in hypertensive rats.Treatment of 
      hypertensive rats with investigated herbs substantially reduced systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of rats. Treatment of rats 
      (n = 5) with L-NAME plus H. sabdariffa plus losartan and L-NAME plus Z. 
      officinale plus losartan reduced SBP by 16.20% and 14.88% and DBP by 14.82% and 
      17.52% respectively after 12 h, as compared to L-NAME alone treated rats. In a 
      pharmacokinetic study, the C(max) and AUC(0-t) of losartan in L-NAME plus H. 
      sabdariffa plus losartan and L-NAME plus Z. officinale plus losartan treated rats 
      was increased by 0.7, 1.99 and 1.51, 3.00 fold respectively in comparison to the 
      C(max) and AUC(0-t) obtained for L-NAME plus losartan treated group. In 
      conclusion, both the investigated herbs significantly increased the 
      antihypertensive effect and plasma concentration of losartan in L-NAME induced 
      hypertensive rats. The current study predicted that the herb-drug interaction 
      between H. sabdariffa-losartan and Z. officinale-losartan could occur; hence 
      these results in rats may warrant further studies in humans, either in humans or 
      in in vitro human liver microsomes.

TI  - Losartan in diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 407-14; discussion 415-6
AB  - Losartan is an orally active, selective, nonpeptide, angiotensin II AT(1) 
      receptor antagonist. Losartan 50 or 100 mg/day was significantly more effective 
      than placebo in reducing the incidence of a doubling of serum creatinine, 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death (43.5% vs 47.1%, p = 0.02) in a pivotal, 
      well designed trial (Reduction of Endpoints in Non insulin dependent diabetes 
      mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan [RENAAL] study) in 1513 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and proteinuria. Losartan also 
      significantly reduced the incidence of doubling of serum creatinine level (p = 
      0.006), ESRD (p = 0.002), ESRD or death (p = 0.01) and doubling of serum 
      creatinine and ESRD (p = 0.01) compared with placebo in the RENAAL trial. There 
      were similar incidences of overall mortality and morbidity and mortality from 
      cardiovascular causes between treatment groups. In addition, data from several 
      nonblind and double-blind studies indicates that losartan effectively reduces the 
      mean albumin excretion rate. Two double-blind studies show that losartan has 
      similar effects to enalapril on kidney function. Data from 4058 patients (3300 
      with essential hypertension) who have received losartan (10-150 mg/day) in 
      clinical trials indicate it is well tolerated. In the RENAAL study 17.2% and 
      21.7% of losartan and placebo recipients discontinued treatment because of 
      adverse events, but causality was not determined.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between losartan and Rhodiola rosea in rabbits.
PG  - 112-6
LID - 10.1159/000345929 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The study investigates the potential interaction of the herbal medicinal 
      product of Rhodiola rosea on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active 
      metabolite EXP3174 after concurrent oral administration to rabbits. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, 
      two-sequence, cross-over pharmacokinetic study on 6 healthy female New Zealand 
      rabbits, after concurrent oral administration of losartan (5 mg/kg) and the 
      herbal medicinal product of R. rosea (50 mg/kg). Quantification of losartan and 
      its main active metabolite EXP3174 was achieved using a validated HPCL/UV method. 
      Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis was performed using the EquivTest/PK 
      software. OBSERVATIONS: Administration of the herbal medicinal product of R. 
      rosea resulted in a statistically significant increase of the following 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for losartan: the maximum plasma concentration 
      (C(max)), the area under the curve (AUC) and the apparent total body clearance 
      (CL/F). An almost 2-fold increase in the AUC of losartan was observed after 
      concurrent administration of the herbal medicinal product of R. rosea. No 
      statistically significant alteration was observed in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of the active metabolite of losartan EXP3174. CONCLUSION: The data of 
      this study suggest that R. rosea significantly alters the pharmacokinetic 
      properties of losartan after concurrent oral administration to rabbits. A study 
      in humans should be conducted to assess the clinical significance of a possible 
      herb-drug interaction between the herbal medicinal products of R. rosea and drugs 
      such as losartan, which are substrates of both CYPs and P-gp.

TI  - Evaluation of [(11)C]methyl-losartan and [(11)C]methyl-EXP3174 for PET imaging of 
      renal AT1receptor in rats.
PG  - 850-7
LID - S0969-8051(15)00112-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2015.06.012 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is responsible for the 
      main effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and its expression pattern is 
      altered in several diseases. The [(11)C]methylated derivatives of the clinically 
      used AT1R blocker (ARB) losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174, that binds 
      with higher affinity to AT1R, were evaluated as potential PET imaging tracers in 
      rat kidneys. METHODS: [(11)C]Methyl-losartan and [(11)C]methyl-EXP3174 were 
      synthesized by [(11)C]methylation of the tetrazole-protected analogs using 
      [11C]methyl iodide. Tissue uptake and binding selectivity of 
      [(11)C]methyl-losartan were assessed by ex-vivo biodistribution and in-vitro 
      autoradiography. Radiolabeled metabolites in rat plasma and kidneys were analysed 
      by column-switch HPLC. Both tracers were evaluated with small animal PET imaging. 
      Due to better pharmacokinetics, [(11)C]methyl-EXP3174 was further investigated 
      via PET by co-injection with AT1R antagonist candesartan or the AT2R antagonist 
      PD123,319. RESULTS: Binding selectivity to renal AT1 over AT2 and Mas receptors 
      was demonstrated for [(11)C]methyl-losartan. Plasma metabolite analysis at 10 min 
      revealed stability of [(11)C]methyl-losartan and [(11)C]methyl-EXP3174 with the 
      presence of unchanged tracer at 70.8 ± 9.9% and 81.4 ± 6.0%, of total 
      radioactivity, respectively. Contrary to [(11)C]methyl-losartan, co-injection of 
      candesartan with [(11)C]methyl-EXP3174 reduced the proportion of unchanged tracer 
      (but not metabolites), indicating that these metabolites do not bind to AT1R in 
      rat kidneys. MicroPET images for both radiotracers displayed high 
      kidney-to-background contrast. Candesartan significantly reduced 
      [(11)C]methyl-EXP3174 uptake in the kidney, whereas no difference was observed 
      following PD123,319 indicating binding selectivity for AT1R. CONCLUSIONS: 
      [(11)C]Methyl-EXP3174 displayed a favorable binding profile compared to 
      [(11)C]methyl-losartan for imaging renal AT1Rs supporting further studies to 
      assess its full potential as a quantitative probe for AT1R via PET.

TI  - Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide: a review of its use in the treatment of 
      hypertension and for stroke risk reduction in patients with hypertension and left 
      ventricular hypertrophy.
PG  - 1239-65
LID - 10.2165/00003495-200969090-00008 [doi]
AB  - Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) [Hyzaar(R)] is a fixed-dose combination of 
      the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) 
      losartan and the thiazide diuretic HCTZ. It is indicated for the treatment of 
      hypertension (including as initial therapy in severe hypertension) and for stroke 
      risk reduction in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy 
      (LVH). Losartan/HCTZ is an effective combination therapy, lowering blood pressure 
      (BP) to a greater extent than losartan or HCTZ alone in patients with 
      hypertension. Other ARB/HCTZ fixed-dose combinations generally lowered BP to a 
      greater extent than losartan/HCTZ in patients with hypertension, although whether 
      this translates into improvements in cardiovascular outcomes is not known. In the 
      LIFE study, losartan-based therapy was associated with a lower incidence of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than atenolol-based therapy, mainly as a 
      result of a reduced risk of stroke; the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus 
      was also lower with losartan-based therapy. Losartan/HCTZ is a well tolerated 
      combination therapy. Thus, losartan/HCTZ remains an important option in the 
      treatment of hypertension, as well as being indicated to reduce stroke risk in 
      patients with hypertension and LVH.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination and Pharmacokinetic Study of Losartan, Losartan 
      Carboxylic Acid, Ramipril, Ramiprilat, and Hydrochlorothiazide in Rat Plasma by a 
      Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method.
PG  - 107-24
LID - 10.3797/scipharm.1410-15 [doi]
AB  - The monitoring of the plasmatic concentrations of cardiovascular drugs is crucial 
      for understanding their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A simple, 
      sensitive, specific, and high-throughput liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous 
      estimation and pharmacokinetic study of losartan (LOS), losartan carboxylic acid 
      (LCA), ramipril (RAM), ramiprilate (RPT), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ) in rat 
      plasma using irbesartan (IBS) and metolazone (MET) as internal standards (ISs). 
      After solid phase extraction (SPE), analytes and ISs were separated on an Agilent 
      Poroshell 120, EC-C18 (50 mm × 4.6 mm, i.d., 2.7 μm) column with a mobile phase 
      consisting of methanol/water (85:15, v/v) containing 5 mmol/L ammonium formate 
      and 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The precursor → product ion 
      transitions for the analytes and ISs were monitored on a triple quadrupole mass 
      spectrometer, operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode and 
      switching the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode during chromatography from 
      positive (to detect LOS, LCA, RAM, RPT, and IBS) to negative (to detect HCZ and 
      MET). The method was validated as per the FDA guidelines and it exhibited 
      sufficient specificity, accuracy, and precision. The method was found to be 
      linear in the range of 3-3000 ng/mL for LOS and LCA, 0.1-200 ng/mL for RAM and 
      RPT, and 1-1500 ng/mL for HCZ. The described method was successfully applied to 
      the preclinical pharmacokinetic study of analytes after oral administration of a 
      mixture of LOS (10 mg/kg), RAM (1 mg/kg), and HCZ (2.5 mg/kg) in rats.

TI  - Differences in pharmacology and their translation into differences in clinical 
      efficacy--a comparison of the renin angiotensin blocking agents irbesartan and 
      losartan.
PG  - 521-35
LID - 10.1517/14656560903512962 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Guidelines recommend five antihypertensive drug classes, 
      but which particular drug to choose is up to the treating physician. We aimed at 
      an in-depth comparison of two frequently used angiotensin receptor blockers to 
      provide evidence for this decision. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Pharmacology of 
      irbesartan and losartan, their blood-pressure-lowering efficacy, their 
      tolerability/safety, end-organ protective effects and economic evaluation. WHAT 
      THE READER WILL GAIN: Both drugs differ in their oral bioavailability, potential 
      for food interactions, degree of metabolism, dosing interval, time to peak, 
      volume of distribution and terminal half-life. Irbesartan provides a greater and 
      longer-lasting antihypertensive effect and was determined to be cost effective 
      over losartan in Denmark and Sweden. Irbesartan was more effective in preventing 
      deterioration of kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy, being 
      cost effective from a German perspective. There is only one end point trial for 
      either drug in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure and 
      atrial fibrillation, but no direct comparison. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: There is an 
      incremental clinical benefit of irbesartan over losartan in the treatment of 
      hypertension and diabetic nephropathy which can be substantiated by corresponding 
      preclinical study evidence. This has translated into an economic benefit in a 
      number of country-specific evaluations.

TI  - Prediction of Losartan-Active Carboxylic Acid Metabolite Exposure Following 
      Losartan Administration Using Static and Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic 
      Models.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate a strategy based on static and dynamic 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling for the prediction of 
      metabolite and parent drug area under the time-concentration curve ratio 
      (AUC(m)/AUC(p)) and their PK profiles in humans using in vitro data when active 
      transport processes are involved in disposition. The strategy was applied to 
      losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite carboxylosartan as test 
      compounds. Hepatobiliary transport including transport-mediated uptake, 
      canilicular and basolateral efflux, and metabolic clearance estimates were 
      obtained from in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and sandwich-cultured 
      hepatocytes. Human renal clearance of carboxylosartan was estimated from dog 
      renal clearance using allometric scaling approach. All clearance mechanisms were 
      mechanistically incorporated in a static model to predict the relative exposure 
      of carboxylosartan versus losartan (AUC(m)/AUC(p)). The predicted AUC(m)/AUC(p) 
      were consistent with the observed data following intravenous and oral 
      administration of losartan. Moreover, the in vitro parameters were used as 
      initial parameters in PBPK permeability-limited disposition models to predict the 
      concentration-time profiles for both parent and its active metabolite after oral 
      administration of losartan. The PBPK model was able to recover the plasma 
      profiles of both losartan and carboxylosartan, further substantiating the 
      validity of this approach.

TI  - Effects of cimetidine on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan, an 
      AT1-selective non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - This was a 2-period randomized, crossover study in 8 healthy males to determine 
      the effects of cimetidine (400 mg q.i.d. for 6 days) on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamic effects of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan (100 
      mg). Cimetidine increased the AUC for losartan 18% without affecting the AUC for 
      E-3174, the active metabolite of losartan. The increase in plasma renin activity 
      following losartan was not affected by cimetidine (maximum mean increases 12.6 
      and 12.1 ng Ang I.ml-1.h-1 without and with cimetidine, respectively). These 
      results indicate that cimetidine does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics or 
      pharmacodynamics of losartan to a clinically significant extent.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of losartan in renal insufficiency.
PG  - S49-52
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of losartan (MK-954) and its metabolite E3174. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A two-center, unblinded trial was performed in 18 patients (age range 
      31-63 years) with various degrees of renal function grouped according to the 
      renal clearance of creatinine: group I, creatinine clearance > or = 75 ml/min; 
      group II, creatinine clearance 30-74 ml/min; group III, creatinine clearance 
      10-29 ml/min (n = 6 in all groups). Losartan (100 mg/day) was administered under 
      supervised conditions for seven consecutive days. Plasma samples were taken for 
      up to 60 h and 24-h urine collections were made following the final dose of 
      losartan (on day 7) to determine losartan and E3174 concentrations, with 
      simultaneous measurements of blood pressure and the pulse rate. RESULTS: The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for losartan and E3174 changed inconsequentially 
      across the range of renal insufficiency. For losartan, renal clearance decreased 
      from 50 +/- 19 ml/min in group I to 2.3 +/- 0.9 ml/min in group III (P < 0.05). 
      For E3174, although the renal clearance decreased from 16 +/- 4.1 ml/min in group 
      I to 1.3 +/- 0.8 ml/min in group III (P < 0.05), the area under the plasma 
      concentration curve did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The steady-state areas under the 
      curve of losartan and E3174 are not significantly changed with renal impairment. 
      The renal clearance of losartan decreases with renal impairment but since only a 
      small percentage of the dose is ordinarily eliminated by the kidney, the 
      demonstrated reduction in clearance is clinically irrelevant. The renal clearance 
      of E3174 also decreases with renal impairment, but the steady-state area under 
      the curve does not increase with increasing degrees of renal insufficiency. These 
      pharmacokinetic alterations do not warrant dose adjustment in the face of renal 
      insufficiency.

TI  - Losartan: a review of its use in stroke risk reduction in patients with 
      hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.
PG  - 2657-74
AB  - Losartan (Cozaar) is an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist. It is approved in 
      numerous countries for the treatment of hypertension and has been approved in the 
      UK, the US and several European countries for stroke risk reduction in patients 
      with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Losartan is recommended 
      for use alone or with hydrochlorothiazide, but it can also be administered with 
      other antihypertensive medications. In patients with hypertension, losartan 
      effectively lowers blood pressure and also leads to regression of LVH. In the 
      large, well designed LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in 
      hypertension) study in patients with hypertension and LVH, losartan was more 
      effective than atenolol in reducing the composite primary endpoint of 
      cardiovascular (CV) mortality, stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). This was 
      mainly due to a significant 25% reduction in the risk of stroke in the losartan 
      group. Losartan recipients also had a significantly lower incidence of new-onset 
      diabetes mellitus compared with atenolol recipients. Similar benefits were 
      observed in several patient subgroups from the LIFE study, but not in the 
      subgroup of Black patients. Losartan is well tolerated and is a cost effective 
      alternative to atenolol in the setting of stroke reduction. Comparative data on 
      clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients for losartan versus other 
      antihypertensive agents would be of interest. Nonetheless, in addition to its 
      established antihypertensive and end organ effects, the LIFE study indicates 
      that, with the possible exception of Black patients, losartan can reduce the risk 
      of stroke in patients with hypertension and LVH.

TI  - Saliva versus plasma pharmacokinetics: theory and application of a salivary 
      excretion classification system.
PG  - 2358-63
LID - 10.1021/mp300250r [doi]
AB  - The aims of this work were to study pharmacokinetics of randomly selected drugs 
      in plasma and saliva samples in healthy human volunteers, and to introduce a 
      Salivary Excretion Classification System. Saliva and plasma samples were 
      collected for 3-5 half-life values of sitagliptin, cinacalcet, metformin, 
      montelukast, tolterodine, hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), lornoxicam, azithromycin, 
      diacerhein, rosuvastatin, cloxacillin, losartan and tamsulosin after oral dosing. 
      Saliva and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental 
      analysis using the Kinetica program. Effective intestinal permeability (Peff) 
      values were estimated by the Nelder-Mead algorithm of the Parameter Estimation 
      module using the SimCYP program. Peff values were optimized to predict the actual 
      average plasma profile of each drug. All other physicochemical factors were kept 
      constant during the minimization processes. Sitagliptin, cinacalcet, metformin, 
      tolterodine, HCT, azithromycin, rosuvastatin and cloxacillin had salivary 
      excretion with correlation coefficients of 0.59-0.99 between saliva and plasma 
      concentrations. On the other hand, montelukast, lornoxicam, diacerhein, losartan 
      and tamsulosin showed no salivary excretion. Estimated Peff ranged 0.16-44.16 × 
      10(-4) cm/s, while reported fraction unbound to plasma proteins (fu) ranged 
      0.01-0.99 for the drugs under investigation. Saliva/plasma concentrations ratios 
      ranged 0.11-13.4, in agreement with drug protein binding and permeability. A 
      Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) was suggested based on drug high 
      (H)/low (L) permeability and high (H)/low (L) fraction unbound to plasma 
      proteins, which classifies drugs into 4 classes. Drugs that fall into class I 
      (H/H), II (L/H) or III (H/L) are subjected to salivary excretion, while those 
      falling into class IV (L/L) are not. Additional data from literature was also 
      analyzed, and all results were in agreement with the suggested SECS. Moreover, a 
      polynomial relationship with correlation coefficient of 0.99 is obtained between 
      S* and C*, where S* and C* are saliva and concentration dimensionless numbers 
      respectively. The proposed Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) can be 
      used as a guide for drug salivary excretion. Future work is planned to test these 
      initial findings, and demonstrate SECS robustness across a range of carefully 
      selected (based on physicochemical properties) drugs that fall into classes I, II 
      or III.

TI  - Drug-drug interaction of losartan and glimepiride metabolism by recombinant 
      microsome CYP2C9*1, 2C9*3, 2C9*13, and 2C9*16 in vitro.
PG  - 732-8
LID - 10.5414/CP202071 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Co-administration of anti-hypertension and anti-diabetic drugs is 
      common in clinical settings. METHODS: In this study, we characterized the 
      drug-drug interactions of losartan (LOS) and glimepiride (GLP) using recombinant 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 enzymes (CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*13, and CYP2C9*16). 
      RESULTS: Metabolism of losartan by recombinant CYP2C9* 1, CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*13, 
      and CYP2C9* 16 was inhibited by glimepiride competitively with IC50 values of 
      0.669 ± 0.055 µM, 0.424 ± 0.032 µM, 2.557 ± 0.058 µM, and 0.667 ± 0.039 µM, 
      respectively. The inhibitory effect of glimepiride on losartan metabolism by 
      CYP2C9*13 was marginal. The apparent Ki value of glimepiride with CYP2C9*3 
      (0.0416 ± 0.0059 µM) was significantly lower than with CYP2C9*1 (0.1476 ± 0.0219 
      µM) and CYP2C9*16 (0.2671 ± 0.0456 µM). On the other hand, losartan weakly 
      inhibited the hydroxylation of glimepiride by P450 2C9 enzymes competitively. The 
      potencies for inhibition of glimepiride hydroxylation were determined to be 
      CYP2C9*1~CYP2C9*3~CYP2C9*16 > CYP2C9*13 by 4 µM losartan. No significant 
      inhibition was observed when 0.5 µM losartan was used. CONCLUSIONS: Given these 
      results, the potential inhibition of losartan metabolism by CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*13, 
      and CYP2C9*16 in vivo by glimepiride deserves further investigation. These 
      results may provide valuable information for optimizing the anti-hypertension 
      efficacy of losartan when glimepiride is co-administered to patients.

TI  - Analysis of losartan and carvedilol in urine and plasma samples using a 
      dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction isocratic HPLC-UV method.
PG  - 2805-21
LID - 10.4155/bio.12.261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A simple, precise and sensitive HPLC method has been developed for 
      simultaneous determination of carvedilol and losartan in human plasma and urine 
      samples. The analytes were extracted by a dispersive liquid-liquid 
      microextraction method. A mobile phase of 15 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate 
      buffer (pH 4.0)/acetonitrile/2-propanol (70/27.5/2.5, v/v/v) was used to separate 
      the drugs using a Waters® ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm) and detected by a UV detector 
      at 222 nm. RESULTS: The developed method is selective for studied drugs 
      possessing a linearity range of 0.1-1.0 and 0.05-0.75 µg/ml, respectively, for 
      losartan and carvedilol with precision <15%. The accuracy is better than 15% and 
      the mean recovery of carvedilol and losartan was 98.9 and 100.2% for plasma and 
      100.7 and 100.5% for urine samples, respectively. CONCLUSION: The developed 
      method is applicable for therapeutic drug monitoring and PK analyses.

TI  - Effects of losartan and benazepril on abnormal circadian blood pressure rhythm 
      and target organ damage in SHRSP.
PG  - 187-205
AB  - The effects of chronic treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) 
      receptor antagonist, and benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
      inhibitor, on target-organ damage and abnormal circadian blood pressure (BP) 
      rhythm were compared in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 
      Losartan and benazepril were given by intraperitoneal infusion for 3 weeks after 
      17 weeks of age to minimize any influence of their different pharmacokinetic 
      properties. BP was continuously monitored by telemetrical method before treatment 
      and at the end of the observation period. The left ventricular (LV) weight, 
      24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UalbV) and morphological changes in the kidney 
      were observed. Losartan and benazepril (1, 3 and 10 mg/day) reduced BP and LV 
      weight in a dose-dependent manner with good correlation between the effects. 
      Losartan significantly improved UalbV in a dose-dependent manner, whereas 
      benazepril was effective at only 10 mg/day. Renal morphological analysis showed 
      that reduction of glomerulosclerosis and collagen fiber thickness was related to 
      the effect on UalbV, but not to the antihypertensive effects. Losartan improved 
      the shifted circadian BP rhythm towards the active phase in a dose-dependent 
      manner, whereas the improvement caused by 1 and 3 mg/day of benazepril was less 
      effective than the same dosage of losartan. These results suggest that both 
      losartan and benazepril can reduce cardiac hypertrophy showing good correlation 
      with their antihypertensive effects, but losartan, especially at a low dose, 
      alleviates renal damage more effectively than benazepril, with its effect 
      correlating well with improvement of the abnormal circadian BP rhythm in SHRSP. 
      Thus, the protective effect against hypertensive target organ damage of the AT1 
      receptor antagonist seems to be more effective than that of ACE inhibitor.

TI  - The effect of bucolome, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - Losartan, a selective angiotensin receptor antagonist, is mainly metabolized by 
      CYP2C9 to an active carboxylic acid, E3174, which is pharmacologically more 
      potent inhibitor than the parent compound. We evaluated the effect of bucolome, a 
      CYP2C9 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174, which were 
      measured by high performance liquid chromatography in human volunteers and rats. 
      A randomized crossover design study with two phases was done in the volunteer 
      study. In the first phase, the volunteers received losartan 25 mg alone orally 
      (LOS group), and, in the second phase, losartan 25 mg was given after repeated 
      oral administration of 300 mg bucolome for 7 days (LOS+BUC group). In the LOS 
      group, the maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration curve 
      (AUC) of losartan were significantly higher than in the LOS+BUC group. On the 
      other hand, in the LOS+BUC group, the C(max) and AUC of E3174 were significantly 
      lower than in the LOS group. In the rat study, male Wistar ST rats were used. In 
      the first phase, the rats orally received losartan 10 mg/kg alone or after 
      bucolome was given repeatedly at a dose of 20, 50, or 200 mg/kg for 7 days. In 
      the second phase for steady state, the rats were given losartan 10 mg/kg for 14 
      days (group A) or losartan 10 mg/kg and bucolome 50 mg/kg for 14 days (Group B). 
      Bucolome at doses 50 and 200 mg/kg significantly increased the AUC losartan and 
      significantly decreased the AUC of 3174. At the steady state, there were no 
      significant differences in AUC of losartan between Group A and B, but the C(max) 
      and AUC of E3174 were significantly lower in Group B than Group A.

PG  - 126-35
LID - 10.5731/pdajpst.2012.00854 [doi]
AB  - The present work comprises the formulation and evaluation of losartan potassium 
      with a view to developing and preparing a losartan potassium releasing system for 
      transdermal applications. The aim of the study was to prepare the transdermal 
      patch of drug using different blends of polymers. Transdermal patches of losartan 
      potassium were prepared using ethyl cellulose (EC): polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), 
      Eudragit RL-100: Eudragit RS-100 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA): polyvinyl 
      pyrrolidone (PVP) using different ratios by the solvent casting technique. 
      Physicochemical parameters like flexibility, thickness, smoothness, moisture 
      content, hardness, and tensile strength were studied. The in vitro permeation 
      study was carried out using a modified Keshery diffusion cell, and the 
      formulation followed the Higuchi diffusion mechanism. The blood pressure lowering 
      response of all formulations was studied using hypertension-induced rats by the 
      chronic renal hypertension method. The formulation containing Eudragit RL-100: 
      Eudragit RS-100 as polymers showed satisfactory drug release pattern (hydrophobic 
      polymers) compared to combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers (EC: 
      PVP) and PVA: PVP (hydrophilic polymers). The amount of drug release from 
      formulations containing hydrophilic polymers and combination of both hydrophobic 
      and hydrophilic polymers were found to be less in comparison to the patches of 
      hydrophobic polymers. LAY ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to prepare 
      and evaluate the transdermal patch of drug using different polymers such as 
      hydrophobic, combination of hydrophobic: hydrophilic, and hydrophilic. Losartan 
      potassium (hydrophilic) is the antihypertensive drug used for lowering increased 
      blood pressure. Transdermal patches of losartan potassium were prepared using 
      different ratios of polymers by the solvent casting technique. The prepared 
      patches were evaluated for their flexibility, thickness, smoothness, moisture 
      content, hardness, and tensile strength. The in vitro permeation study was 
      carried out using a diffusion cell. The blood lowering response of all 
      formulations was studied using hypertension-induced rats. The formulation 
      containing hydrophobic polymers showed a satisfactory drug release pattern 
      compared to the combination of hydrophobic: hydrophilic polymers and the 
      hydrophilic polymers. Hence, the present study reveals that formulation of 
      hydrophilic drug (losartan potassium) withhydrophobic polymers exhibit good 
      release properties as compared to that of hydrophilic polymers and combination of 
      both hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1018892108 [doi]
AB  - The dense collagen network in tumors significantly reduces the penetration and 
      efficacy of nanotherapeutics. We tested whether losartan--a clinically approved 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist with noted antifibrotic activity--can enhance 
      the penetration and efficacy of nanomedicine. We found that losartan inhibited 
      collagen I production by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts isolated from breast 
      cancer biopsies. Additionally, it led to a dose-dependent reduction in stromal 
      collagen in desmoplastic models of human breast, pancreatic, and skin tumors in 
      mice. Furthermore, losartan improved the distribution and therapeutic efficacy of 
      intratumorally injected oncolytic herpes simplex viruses. Finally, it also 
      enhanced the efficacy of i.v. injected pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). 
      Thus, losartan has the potential to enhance the efficacy of nanotherapeutics in 
      patients with desmoplastic tumors.

TI  - Prediction of area under the curve for a p-glycoprotein, a CYP3A4 and a CYP2C9 
      substrate using a single time point strategy: assessment using fexofenadine, 
      itraconazole and losartan and metabolites.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present age of polypharmacy, limited sampling strategy becomes 
      important to verify if drug levels are within the prescribed threshold limits 
      from efficacy and safety considerations. The need to establish reliable single 
      time concentration dependent models to predict exposure becomes important from 
      cost and time perspectives. METHODS: A simple unweighted linear regression model 
      was developed to describe the relationship between Cmax versus AUC for 
      fexofenadine, losartan, EXP3174, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole. The fold 
      difference, defined as the quotient of the observed and predicted AUC values, 
      were evaluated along with statistical comparison of the predicted versus observed 
      values. RESULTS: The correlation between Cmax versus AUC was well established for 
      all the five drugs with a correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.9130 to 
      0.9997. Majority of the predicted values for all the five drugs (77%) were 
      contained within a narrow boundary of 0.75- to 1.5-fold difference. The r values 
      for observed versus predicted AUC were 0.9653 (n = 145), 0.8342 (n = 76), 0.9524 
      (n = 88), 0.9339 (n = 89) and 0.9452 (n = 66) for fexofenadine, losartan, 
      EXP3174, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cmax 
      versus AUC relationships were established for all drugs and were amenable for 
      limited sampling strategy for AUC prediction. However, fexofenadine, EXP3174 and 
      hydroxyitraconazole may be most relevant for AUC prediction by a single time 
      concentration as judged by the various criteria applied in this study.

TI  - Tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan as probes of CYP2C9 activity in humans.
PG  - 84-91
AB  - The metabolic activity of CYP2C9 in 16 subjects expressing four different 
      genotypes (CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, and *2/*2) was evaluated. Single oral doses 
      of tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan were administered in a randomized, 
      crossover design. Plasma and urine were collected over 24 hours. The urinary 
      metabolic ratio and amount of metabolite(s) excreted were correlated with 
      formation clearance. The formation clearance of tolbutamide to its 
      CYP2C9-mediated metabolites demonstrated a stronger association with genotype 
      compared to flurbiprofen and losartan, respectively (r2 = 0.64 vs. 0.53 vs. 
      0.42). A statistically significant correlation was observed between formation 
      clearance of tolbutamide and the 0- to 12-hour urinary amount of 
      4'-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (r = 0.84). Compared to tolbutamide, 
      the correlations observed between the respective measures of flurbiprofen and 
      losartan metabolism were not as strong. Tolbutamide is a better CYP2C9 probe than 
      flurbiprofen and losartan, and the 0- to 12-hour amount of 4'-hydroxytolbutamide 
      and carboxytolbutamide is the best urinary measure of its metabolism.

TI  - Preparation of Losartan Potassium Controlled Release Matrices and In-Vitro 
      Investigation Using Rate Controlling Agents.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27030864 [doi]
LID - 864
AB  - Controlled release matrices have predictable drug release kinetics, provide drugs 
      for an extended period of time, and reduce dosing frequency with improved patient 
      compliance as compared with conventional tablet dosage forms. In the current 
      research work, losartan potassium controlled release matrix tablets were 
      fabricated and prepared with rate altering agents; that is, Ethocel grade 100 
      combined with Carbopol 934PNF. Various drug to polymer ratios were used. HPMC, 
      CMC, and starch were incorporated in some of the matrices by replacing some 
      amount of filler (5%). The direct compression method was adopted for the 
      preparation of matrices. In phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), the dissolution study was 
      conducted by adopting the USP method-I as the specified method. Drug release 
      kinetics was determined and dissolution profiles were also compared with the 
      reference standard. Prolonged release was observed for all matrices, but those 
      with Ethocel 100FP Premium showed more extended release. The co-excipient (HPMC, 
      CMC, and starch) exhibited enhancement in the drug release rates, while all 
      controlled release matrices released the drug by anamolous non-Fickian diffusion 
      mechanism. This combination of polymers (Ethocel grade 100 with Carbopol 934PNF) 
      efficiently extended the drug release rates up to 24 h. It is suggested that 
      these matrix tablets can be given in once a day dosage, which might improve 
      patient compliance, and the polymeric blend of Ethocel grade 100 with Carbopol 
      934PNF might be used in the development of prolonged release matrices of other 
      water-soluble drugs.

TI  - The physicochemical properties, in vitro metabolism and pharmacokinetics of a 
      novel ester prodrug of EXP3174.
PG  - 2132-40

AB  - EXP3174 is the major active metabolite of losartan, a drug currently widely used 
      for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to evaluate 
      the physicochemical properties of EXP3174-pivoxil (a novel synthesized prodrug of 
      EXP3174) and characterize its metabolism, regional intestinal absorption and 
      pharmacokinetics by in vitro and in vivo studies. An in vitro metabolism study 
      was conducted in liver and intestinal S9 fractions from different species 
      including rat, dog and human. In vivo absorption was investigated following 
      regional intestinal dosing in rats, and the pharmacokinetics was determined using 
      rats after a single oral administration. EXP3174-pivoxil exhibited predictable 
      stability in the aqueous solution within a pH range of 1.2-9.0 as well as in the 
      solid form of powder. An in vitro metabolism study revealed that EXP3174-pivoxil 
      was rapidly and efficiently converted into EXP3174 by enzymatic hydrolysis. The 
      dose administered into the duodenum and jejunum resulted in higher values for the 
      AUC(0-24h) and C(max) than those following ileum dosing (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 
      the AUC(0-24h) and C(max) values for EXP3174 increased in a dose-dependent manner 
      as dose increased from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg. A comparable AUC(0-24h), shortened T(max) 
      and a significant increase in the plasma C(max) of EXP3174 were observed 
      following oral administration of EXP3174-pivoxil (as EXP3174, 1 mg/kg) compared 
      with those of losartan (as EXP3174, 5 mg/kg) in rats, suggesting faster 
      absorption and a 5-fold enhancement in the bioavailability of EXP3174. These 
      results suggest that EXP3174-pivoxil may serve as a more effective drug even at 
      lower clinical doses by exhibiting increased bioavailability and faster 
      therapeutic response, compared with losartan.

TI  - Combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide: in vivo bioequivalence.
PG  - 611-7
AB  - Two trials were performed in different groups of volunteers with the aim to 
      compare the bioavailability of 50 mg losartan tablets (Sarvas as test and an 
      originator product as reference formulation; study 1) and 
      losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/12.5 mg) (CAS 124750-99-8/CAS 58-93-5) 
      combined formulations (Sarvastan as test and an originator product as reference 
      formulation; study 2), respectively. Each study was conducted according to an 
      open, randomized, single-dose, two-period cross-over design in 24 healthy 
      volunteers with a wash-out period from 7 to 14 days. Blood samples were taken up 
      to 36 h in the first study and up to 48 h in the second study. Concentrations of 
      losartan and its principal active metabolite, i.e. E3174, as well as 
      hydrochlorothiazide were determined by HPLC or LC-MS-MS, respectively. In the 
      first study, the 90% confidence interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t 
      and Cmax of losartan were between 0.91 and 1.03 (AUC0-t) as well as between 0.87 
      and 1.19 (Cmax), and thus within the acceptance ranges. The 90% confidence 
      interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t, and Cmax of E3174 were between 
      0.90 and 1.13 for AUC0-t, and between 0.97 and 1.14 for Cmax. In the second 
      study, i.e. after administration of combined losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
      formulations, the 90% confidence interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t 
      and Cmax of losartan were between 0.90 and 1.04 (AUC0-t) as well as between 0.86 
      and 1.20 (Cmax). Similarly to the parent compound, no significant differences of 
      bioavailability parameters of E3174 between the two studied formulations were 
      found. The 90% confidence interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t and Cmax 
      of hydrochlorothiazide were between 0.89 and 0.98 (AUC0-t) as well as between 
      0.82 and 1.00 (Cmax). In the light of the present studies it can be concluded 
      that the losartan as well as losartan/hydrochlorothiazide test formulations are 
      bioequivalent to the respective reference formulations.

LID - 10.4103/2229-4708.97711 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometric assay method has been developed and fully validated for 
      simultaneous quantification of losartan and its active metabolite, losartan 
      carboxylic acid, and amlodipine in human plasma. Irbesartan was used as an 
      internal standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analytes were extracted from human 
      plasma samples by solid-phase extraction technique using Oasis HLB cartridges, 
      (Waters Corporation, Mumbai, India). The reconstituted samples were 
      chromatographed on a C18 column by using an 85:15, v/v mixture of methanol and 
      0.1% v/v formic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. A detailed 
      validation of the method was performed as per the FDA guidelines. RESULTS: The 
      calibration curves obtained were linear (r ≥ 0.99) over the concentration range 
      of 0.5-1000 ng/mL for losartan and for its active metabolite losartan acid and 
      0.05-10.1 ng/mL for amlodipine. The results of the intra- and inter-day precision 
      and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. CONCLUSIONS: A run 
      time of 2.5 min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 plasma 
      samples per day. The proposed method was found to be applicable to clinical 
      studies.

AB  - We conducted a thorough study of Cu(2+) complex formation equilibria with 
      Irbesartan and Losartan, the two primary drugs for the cure of cardiovascular 
      diseases, with the aim of recognising if these drugs could exert a chelating 
      action towards Cu(2+). We used different complementary techniques to gain a clear 
      picture of the involved protonation and complexation equilibria. The low 
      solubility in water of the ligands and of the formed metal complexes prevented 
      the use of water as solvent, so we had to perform the measurements in mixed 
      methanol-water solvents. Further, we studied the related equilibria with Zn(2+) 
      for evaluating a potential interference of this essential metal ion, largely 
      present in biological fluids. Our study provided a strong evaluation of the 
      formed complexes and of the relative stability constants. The binding of both 
      metal ions takes place through the tetrazole moiety except for the 
      Zn(2+)-Irbesartan system. In this last case, NMR measurements gave evidence of a 
      tautomeric equilibrium involving the imidazole ring and the aliphatic chain. The 
      estimated complexation model, and the related stability constants, allowed a 
      speciation study in human plasma, based on a number of simplifying assumptions, 
      which remarked that both drugs, Losartan and Irbesartan, could exert a chelating 
      action, scavenging non-negligible amounts of Cu(2+) from the organism.

TI  - Prediction of CYP-mediated silybin A-losartan pharmacokinetic interactions using 
      physiological based pharmacokinetic modeling.
PG  - 311-323
LID - 10.1007/s10928-022-09804-0 [doi]
AB  - The concomitant use of herbal products and synthetic drugs necessitates the 
      assessment of their interaction potentials. The herbal hepatoprotective medicine, 
      silybin A inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4 enzymes, thus, may interact 
      with the drugs that are substrates of CYP2C9 and 3A4, such as losartan. The three 
      most prominent genotypes, expressed by CYP2C9 are the CYP2C9*1/*1, CYP2C9*1/*2 
      and CYP2C9*1/*3. This study aimed to assess silybin A-losartan interaction in 
      different CYP2C9 genotypes using physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model 
      approach. The individual PBPK models for silybin A and losartan were developed 
      using PK-Sim®. Losartan pharmacokinetics was predicted with or without 
      co-administration of silybin A in individuals of different CYP2C9 genotypes to 
      find herbal-drug interaction. The predicted drug plasma curves and 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were optimized using parameter identification tool and 
      were compared with reported pharmacokinetic parameters from the published 
      clinical studies for model validation. The silybin-losartan interactions were 
      predicted by change in area under the curve (AUC) and peak systemic concentration 
      (C(max)). The co-treatment of silybin A, 420 mg/24 h (140 mg/8 h) with losartan 
      50 mg/24 h, exhibited a genotype-dependent change in the losartan's AUC and 
      C(max). In CYP 2C9*1/*1 genotype, AUC and C(max) of losartan were increased 1.16 
      and 1.37 folds, respectively falling in a range stipulated for negligible 
      interaction. Increase in AUC and C(max) by 0.873 and 0.294 folds, respectively in 
      CYP2C9*1/*3 after co-administration of silybin A exhibited a minor interaction 
      with losartan. However, in individuals with CYP2C9*1/*2 genotype, the losartan's 
      AUC and C(max) were decreased by 0.01 folds, manifesting a moderate interaction. 
      Hence, in CYP2C9*1/*1 and CYP2C9*1/*3 genotypes, silybin A is a weak CYP 
      inhibitor for losartan while in CYP2C9*1/*2 genotype, the co-administration of 
      silybin consequents into a moderate pharmacokinetic interaction with losartan.

AB  - We investigated botanical drug-pharmaceutical drug interactions between DW1029M 
      (a botanical extract of Morus alba linne root bark and Puerariae radix) and 
      metformin, losartan, and linagliptin in the steady state. Three studies were 
      conducted as randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-treatment, multiple-dose, 2-way 
      crossover designs. Eligible subjects received metformin (500 mg twice daily), 
      losartan (50 mg once daily), or linagliptin (5 mg once daily) with DW1029M 
      (300 mg × 2T twice daily) every 12 hours on days 1 through 6 and a single dose on 
      the morning of day 7. Coadministration of DW1029M with metformin, losartan, or 
      linagliptin had no clinically relevant effects based on the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC(τ) ) geometric least-squares mean ratio (GMR) - 
      AUC(τ) GMR, 89.7; 90% confidence interval (CI), 81.0-99.4 for metformin; AUC(τ) 
      GMR, 96.2; 90%CI, 86.3-107.1 for losartan; and AUC(τ) GMR, 89.7; 90%CI, 83.2-96.6 
      for linagliptin. In addition, coadministration of DW1029M did not have any 
      clinically meaningful effect on the maximum plasma concentration (C(max,ss) ) - 
      C(max,ss) GMR, 87.3; 90%CI, 76.2-100.0 for metformin; C(max,ss) GMR, 90.5; 90%CI, 
      78.3-104.6 for losartan; and C(max,ss) GMR, 81.4; 90%CI, 69.5-95.3 for 
      linagliptin. Coadministration of DW1029M with metformin, losartan, or linagliptin 
      was well tolerated.

TI  - Efficacy of Losartan in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19-Induced Lung Injury: 
      A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e222735
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.2735 [doi]
LID - e222735
AB  - IMPORTANCE: SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may disrupt angiotensin II (AII) homeostasis, 
      contributing to COVID-19 induced lung injury. AII type 1 receptor blockade 
      mitigates lung injury in preclinical models, although data in humans with 
      COVID-19 remain mixed. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of losartan to reduce lung 
      injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 13 
      hospitals in the United States from April 2020 to February 2021. Hospitalized 
      patients with COVID-19 and a respiratory sequential organ failure assessment 
      score of at least 1 and not already using a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
      (RAAS) inhibitor were eligible for participation. Data were analyzed from April 
      19 to August 24, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Losartan 50 mg orally twice daily vs 
      equivalent placebo for 10 days or until hospital discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was the imputed arterial partial pressure of oxygen 
      to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2:Fio2) ratio at 7 days. Secondary outcomes 
      included ordinal COVID-19 severity; days without supplemental o2, ventilation, or 
      vasopressors; and mortality. Losartan pharmacokinetics and RAAS components (AII, 
      angiotensin-[1-7] and angiotensin-converting enzymes 1 and 2)] were measured in a 
      subgroup of participants. RESULTS: A total of 205 participants (mean [SD] age, 
      55.2 [15.7] years; 123 [60.0%] men) were randomized, with 101 participants 
      assigned to losartan and 104 participants assigned to placebo. Compared with 
      placebo, losartan did not significantly affect Pao2:Fio2 ratio at 7 days 
      (difference, -24.8 [95%, -55.6 to 6.1]; P = .12). Compared with placebo, losartan 
      did not improve any secondary clinical outcomes and led to fewer vasopressor-free 
      days than placebo (median [IQR], 9.4 [9.1-9.8] vasopressor-free days vs 8.7 
      [8.2-9.3] vasopressor-free days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized 
      clinical trial found that initiation of orally administered losartan to 
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and acute lung injury did not improve 
      Pao2:Fio2 ratio at 7 days. These data may have implications for ongoing clinical 
      trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04312009.

TI  - Synthesis and Evaluation of [(18)F]FEtLos and [(18)F]AMBF(3)Los as Novel 
      (18)F-Labelled Losartan Derivatives for Molecular Imaging of Angiotensin II Type 
      1 Receptors.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25081872 [doi]
LID - 1872
AB  - Losartan is widely used in clinics to treat cardiovascular related diseases by 
      selectively blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)Rs), which 
      regulate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Therefore, monitoring the 
      physiological and pathological biodistribution of AT(1)R using positron emission 
      tomography (PET) might be a valuable tool to assess the functionality of RAS. 
      Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of two novel losartan 
      derivatives PET tracers, [(18)F]fluoroethyl-losartan ([(18)F]FEtLos) and 
      [(18)F]ammoniomethyltrifluoroborate-losartan ([(18)F]AMBF(3)Los). [(18)F]FEtLos 
      was radiolabeled by (18)F-fluoroalkylation of losartan potassium using the 
      prosthetic group 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl tosylate; whereas [(18)F]AMBF(3)Los was 
      prepared following an one-step (18)F-(19)F isotopic exchange reaction, in an 
      overall yield of 2.7 ± 0.9% and 11 ± 4%, respectively, with high radiochemical 
      purity (>95%). Binding competition assays in AT(1)R-expressing membranes showed 
      that AMBF(3)Los presented an almost equivalent binding affinity (K(i) 7.9 nM) as 
      the cold reference Losartan (K(i) 1.5 nM), unlike FEtLos (K(i) 2000 nM). In vitro 
      and in vivo assays showed that [(18)F]AMBF(3)Los displayed a good binding 
      affinity for AT(1)R-overexpressing CHO cells and was able to specifically bind to 
      renal AT(1)R. Hence, our data demonstrate [(18)F]AMBF(3)Los as a new tool for PET 
      imaging of AT(1)R with possible applications for the diagnosis of cardiovascular, 
      inflammatory and cancer diseases.

TI  - Effect of soy extract administration on losartan pharmacokinetics in healthy 
      female volunteers.
PG  - 1045-9
LID - 10.1345/aph.1L690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: osartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, 
      E-3174, which has greater antihypertensive activity than the parent compound. Soy 
      extract has been shown to be an activator of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in vitro. 
      Coadministration of soy extract and losartan may therefore alter the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and E-3174. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether, when 
      losartan was used in combination with soy extract, a significant pharmacokinetic 
      interaction would be observed in healthy female volunteers. METHODS: Eighteen 
      healthy Chinese female volunteers were recruited. In an open-label, 2-phase 
      study, losartan 50 mg was given to each subject, with and without soy extract. 
      Plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174 were determined by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 12 and 24 hours, respectively. On day 
      8 through day 21 of the study, following a 7-day washout period, each subject 
      consumed two 1000-mg Genistein Soy Complex tablets orally after meals, twice 
      daily, for 14 days. On day 22, all volunteers received losartan 50 mg and blood 
      samples were collected again. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, without 
      adverse drug effects. Over the 14-day pretreatment period, soy extract did not 
      significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174. The ratio of 
      the area under the curve of the drug and metabolite after losartan 
      administration, with and without soy extract ingestion, was 0.21 +/- 0.05 and 
      0.23 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD), respectively. The difference was not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a significant 
      interaction between soy extract and losartan is unlikely to occur in females.

PG  - 371-7; discussion 378-9
AB  - Losartan binds selectively to the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor, blocking the 
      activity of angiotensin II. Losartan 50-100 mg/day was compared with atenolol 
      50-100 mg/day in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular 
      hypertrophy (LVH) [n = 9,193] in the randomized, double-blind Losartan 
      Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study. Two substudies 
      compared these drugs in patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 1,195) or isolated 
      systolic hypertension (ISH) [n = 1326]. The target BP (<140/90 mm Hg) was 
      achieved in approximate, equals 45% of losartan and atenolol recipients in the 
      LIFE study. Significant regression of LVH occurred with losartan versus atenolol 
      in the LIFE study, as well as in the diabetes mellitus and ISH substudies. In the 
      LIFE study, although BP reduction was similar for the two treatments, the risk of 
      a cardiovascular event (the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, and 
      myocardial infarction; primary endpoint), stroke, or new-onset diabetes mellitus 
      was significantly lower with losartan than with atenolol. Losartan was generally 
      well tolerated in patients with hypertension and LVH in the LIFE study. 
      Significantly fewer losartan than atenolol recipients discontinued treatment 
      because of adverse events, drug-related adverse events, or serious, drug-related 
      adverse events.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relations of losartan and EXP3174 in a porcine 
      animal model.
PG  - 583-90
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of losartan and EXP3174, an active metabolite of losartan, 
      were evaluated in the anesthetized pig after both a single intravenous dose (3 
      mg/kg) and during constant intravenous infusion. The pharmacodynamic activities 
      of losartan and EXP3174 were determined during constant intravenous infusion as 
      the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II-induced increase in the diastolic 
      pressure. The systemic plasma clearance of losartan was 22.1 +/- 4.4 ml/min/kg 
      (mean +/- SEM) and had an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 0.56 
      +/- 0.16 L/kg after a 3-mg/kg intravenous dose. The elimination half-life of 
      losartan was 40 +/- 6 min. Less than 2% of the intravenous losartan doses was 
      estimated to be present as unconjugated EXP3174. The plasma clearance of EXP3174 
      was approximately 50% that of losartan, 11.8 +/- 1.5 ml/min/kg, and had a smaller 
      steady-state apparent volume of distribution, 0.18 +/- 0.04 L/kg. The elimination 
      half-life for EXP3174 was slightly longer than that of losartan (52 min). The 
      time course of the pharmacodynamic effects of losartan and EXP3174 closely 
      followed their respective plasma concentrations. The apparent dissociation 
      constant of EXP3174 to the angiotensin II receptor was estimated, based on the 
      total plasma concentrations, to be approximately 5 times lower than that for 
      losartan.

      Antihypertensive Agent, in Sprague-Dawley Rats.
PG  - 1299-309
LID - 10.1080/15287394.2015.1085355 [doi]
AB  - Red ginseng (RG) is one of the top selling herbal medicines in Korea, but is not 
      recommended in hypertensive patients. In this study, the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      interaction between RG and losartan, an antihypertensive drug, was examined. RG 
      was orally administered for 2 wk to male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats at either 
      control (0), 0.5, 1, or 2 g/kg/d for 2 wk. After the last administration of RG 
      and 30 min later, all animals were treated with 10 mg/kg losartan by oral route. 
      In addition, some S-D rats were administered RG orally for 21 d at 2 g/kg 
      followed by losartan intravenously (iv) at 10 mg/kg/d. Post losartan 
      administration, plasma samples were collected at 5, 15, and 30 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 
      3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174, the active 
      metabolite of losartan, were analyzed by a high-pressure liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer system (LC-MS/MS). Oral losartan 
      administration showed dose-dependent pharmacokinetics (PK) increase with time to 
      maximum plasma, but this was not significant between different groups. There was 
      no significant change in tmax with E-3174 PK. With iv losartan, pharmacokinetics 
      showed elevation of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero 
      extrapolated to infinitity. There was not a significant change in AUCinf with 
      E-3174 PK. Therefore, RG appeared to interfere with biotransformation of 
      losartan, as RG exerted no marked effect on E-3174 PK in S-D rats. Data 
      demonstrated that oral or iv treatment with losartan in rats pretreated with RG 
      for 2 wk showed that losartan PK was affected but E-3174 PK remained unchanged 
      among different dose groups. These results suggested that RG induces negligible 
      influence on losartan and E-3174 PK in rats.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EXP3174 
      (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4- 
      yl-)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, 
      were studied in conscious rats. Elimination half-life, systemic clearance, and 
      apparent volume of distribution of EXP3174 at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. were 2.9 h, 
      1.8 ml/min/kg, and 0.25 l/kg, respectively. Inhibition of the angiotensin II 
      pressor response correlated with the log of the steady state plasma EXP3174 
      concentration in a sigmoidal fashion with an IC50 of about 200 ng/ml. When 
      corrected for plasma protein binding, the IC50 (free) for EXP3174 was 0.4 ng/ml 
      (0.9 nmol/l). This study indicates a predictable plasma concentration-effect 
      relationship of EXP3174 in rats which would be helpful in designing more rational 
      dosing schemes for pharmacodynamic studies.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide,

PG  - 659-66
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0080-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel iron-based phosphate binder sucroferric oxyhydroxide is 
      being investigated for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Patients with chronic 
      kidney disease often have multiple comorbidities that may necessitate the daily 
      use of several types of medication. Therefore, the potential pharmacokinetic 
      drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and selected drugs 
      commonly taken by dialysis patients were investigated. METHODS: Five Phase I, 
      single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover studies in healthy 
      volunteers investigated the effect of a single dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide 1 
      g (based on iron content) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan 100 mg, furosemide 
      40 mg, omeprazole 40 mg, digoxin 0.5 mg and warfarin 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters [including area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 
      time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-∞) and from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24)] for 
      these drugs were determined: alone in the presence of food; with sucroferric 
      oxyhydroxide in the presence of food; 2 h after food and sucroferric oxyhydroxide 
      administration. RESULTS: Systemic exposure based on AUC0-∞ for all drugs, and 
      AUC0-24 for all drugs except omeprazole (for which AUC 0-8 h was measured), was 
      unaffected to a clinically significant extent by the presence of sucroferric 
      oxyhydroxide, irrespective of whether sucroferric oxyhydroxide was administered 
      with the drug or 2 h earlier. CONCLUSIONS: There is a low risk of drug-drug 
      interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide, digoxin 
      and warfarin. There is also a low risk of drug-drug interaction with omeprazole 
      (based on AUC0-∞ values). Therefore, sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be administered 
      concomitantly without the need to adjust the dosage regimens of these drugs.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of losartan potassium in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 56-65
AB  - Losartan potassium is the first of a new class of orally active antihypertensive 
      drugs which antagonise the action of angiotensin (AT) II at the AT1 receptor 
      subtype. Losartan potassium is converted by the liver to the active metabolite 
      E-3174, which is a more potent antagonist at the AT1 receptor. E-3174 is 
      responsible for most of the pharmacological effects of losartan potassium, and 
      its long half-life contributes to the extended duration of action of the drug. 
      Losartan potassium is effective as a once-daily antihypertensive agent. In mild 
      to moderate hypertension, losartan potassium has similar efficacy to enalapril, 
      atenolol and felodipine extended release. When losartan potassium is combined 
      with hydrochlorothiazide there is a further reduction in blood pressure. Losartan 
      potassium is well tolerated in mild, moderate and severe essential hypertension, 
      with dizziness being reported as the only drug-related adverse effect. The 
      overall rate of patient withdrawal from therapy due to adverse experiences with 
      losartan potassium is lower (2.3%) than that of placebo (3.7%). First-dose 
      hypotension is uncommon, perhaps due to the slower onset of action of the drug, 
      and cough does not appear to be a significant problem. A number of areas 
      concerning the safety and efficacy of losartan potassium remain to be clarified. 
      In particular, long term tolerability studies are needed; cough only became 
      apparent as an adverse effect of ACE inhibitors after 3 to 4 years of use. 
      Postmarketing surveillance has shown that angioedema, a rare but life-threatening 
      adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, also occurs with losartan potassium. Further 
      data are needed on the use of losartan potassium in patients with renal 
      impairment before accepting the recommendation that dosage adjustment is not 
      necessary. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of losartan potassium in 
      patients with hepatic disease also require further investigation. Losartan 
      potassium increases uric acid secretion and lowers plasma uric acid levels, which 
      may be of benefit when losartan potassium is combined with a thiazide diuretic, 
      but which may otherwise lead to uric acid stone formation and possibly to 
      nephropathy. Simple control of blood pressure is no longer an adequate goal in 
      the management of hypertension. Any new antihypertensive agent should also reduce 
      cardiovascular events, prevent or cause regression of end-organ damage such as 
      left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and renal failure, and should not 
      impair quality of life. Such data on losartan potassium are not currently 
      available. Losartan potassium is likely to be used in patients who are intolerant 
      of ACE inhibitors, but its future in the management of hypertension will depend 
      on long term tolerability studies and data on its effects beyond simple blood 
      pressure control.

PG  - 3388-94
LID - 10.1002/jssc.200900287 [doi]
AB  - A rapid LC-MS/MS method has been developed and validated for the determination of 
      losartan (LOS) and its metabolite losartan acid (LA) (EXP-3174) in human plasma 
      using multiplexing technique (two HPLC units connected to one MS/MS). LOS and LA 
      were extracted from human plasma by SPE technique using Oasis HLB cartridge 
      without evaporation and reconstitution steps. Hydroflumethiazide (HFTZ) was used 
      as an internal standard (IS). The analytes were separated on Zorbax SB C-18 
      column. The mass transition [M-H] ions used for detection were m/z 421.0 --> 
      127.0 for LOS, m/z 435.0 --> 157.0 for LA, and m/z 330.0 --> 239.0 for HFTZ. The 
      proposed method was validated over the concentration range of 2.5-2000 ng/mL for 
      LOS and 5.0-3000 ng/mL for LA with correlation coefficient > or = 0.9993. The 
      overall recoveries for LOS, LA, and IS were 96.53, 99.86, and 94.16%, 
      respectively. Total MS run time was 2.0 min/sample. The validated method has been 
      successfully used to analyze human plasma samples for applications in 100 mg 
      fasted and fed pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions of candesartan cilexetil and 
      losartan.
PG  - 561-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The variability of the blood pressure response to blockade of the 
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor is influenced by renin status and pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions of two doses of an ester prodrug of 
      a noncompetitive angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, candesartan 
      cilexetil, at 8 and 16 mg, with those of the reference angiotenisn II type 1 
      receptor blocker, losartan, at the standard dose (50 mg), in a human model that 
      controls renin status. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled 
      crossover study, we compared the effects on renin and mean blood pressure over 24 
      h of single oral doses of candesartan cilexetil at 8 and 16 mg and losartan at 50 
      mg in 16 sodium-depleted normotensive subjects. RESULTS: The area under the curve 
      (0-24 h) for plasma active renin did not differ significantly between 8 mg 
      candesartan cilexetil and 50 mg losartan, but was significantly higher for 16 
      than for 8 mg candesartan cilexetil or for 50 mg losartan. The area under the 
      curve (0-24 h) for the fall in mean blood pressure with 16 mg candesartan 
      cilexetil (-197 +/- 96 mmHg/h) was significantly greater than that for placebo 
      (-112 +/- 81 mmHg/h; P< 0.05) but the difference was not statistically 
      significant compared with either 8 mg candesartan cilexetil (-158 +/- 95 mmHg/h) 
      or 50 mg losartan (-144 +/- 66 mmHg/h). The area under the curve (0-24 h) for the 
      fall in mean blood pressure did not significantly differ between 8 mg candesartan 
      cilexetil, 50 mg losartan and placebo. The area under the curve (0-24 h) for 
      plasma active renin was significantly correlated to that for plasma levels of the 
      active metabolite of losartan, EXP 3174 (r = 0.65, n = 16, P< 0.01). No such 
      correlation was detected for each single dose of candesartan cilexetil but a 
      dose-response relationship was present when both doses were combined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral dose of 16 mg 
      candesartan cilexetil are greater than those of 50 mg losartan and 8 mg 
      candesartan cilexetil. The variability in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      interaction is less pronounced for candesartan than for EXP 3174, which could 
      result in reduced variability of the blood pressure effects in patients.

TI  - Effects of erythromycin or rifampin on losartan pharmacokinetics in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 316-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, 
      E3174, which has greater antihypertensive activity than the parent compound. 
      Coadministered drugs that inhibit or induce metabolic processes may therefore 
      alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic response of losartan and E3174. 
      OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were studied to assess the effects 
      of CYP3A4 inhibition and nonspecific P450 enzyme induction on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174. Subjects completed three 1-week phases 
      separated by 6 days: 50 mg losartan every morning, losartan plus 500 mg 
      erythromycin four times a day, and losartan plus 300 mg rifampin (INN, 
      rifampicin) twice a day. On the eighth day of each phase, serial plasma 
      concentrations of losartan and E3174 were obtained over 32 hours and steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics were determined. RESULTS: Rifampin decreased the area under the 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours after the dose (AUC[0-24]) of 
      losartan by 35% (349 +/- 246 versus 225 +/- 130; p = 0.0001) and decreased the 
      AUC(0-24) of E3174 by 40% (1336 +/- 445 versus 792 +/- 302; p < 0.005). Losartan 
      oral clearance was increased by 44% (p = 0.0001). The half-life values of both 
      compounds were decreased by 50% (p < 0.005). In contrast, erythromycin did not 
      significantly affect the AUC(0-24) or half-life of either losartan or E3174. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rifampin is a potent inducer of losartan and E3174 elimination. 
      Given the magnitude of the effect, this interaction is likely to be clinically 
      significant. On the basis of the minimal inhibitory effects observed with 
      erythromycin, CYP3A4 appears to play a minor role in the in vivo metabolism of 
      losartan to E3174. Further studies are needed to define the contribution of other 
      isozymes, particularly CYP2C9, to the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174.

TI  - Angiotensin II-induced drinking and pressor responses to central or systemic 
      irbesartan and losartan.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - Angiotensin II (ANG II) is a peptide hormone that is important for maintaining 
      blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis. Two nonpeptide angiotensin type 1 
      (AT(1)) receptor antagonists, irbesartan and losartan, were compared for their 
      antidipsogenic and antihypertensive efficacy in both normotensive and 
      hypertensive rats. ANG II-induced drinking and pressor responses were examined 
      following central or systemic administration of irbesartan and losartan. Both 
      agents inhibited the drinking response to ANG II in normotensive rats. Irbesartan 
      was more effective than losartan at inhibiting pressor responses to ANG II in 
      normotensive and hypertensive rats. These data indicate that centrally 
      administered irbesartan may be somewhat more effective as an AT(1) receptor 
      antagonist than losartan. However, evaluating the antihypertensive efficacy of 
      these drugs when administered systemically is complex due to several 
      pharmacokinetic factors (e.g., metabolism and lipophilicity).

AB  - The aim of this study was to formulate and evaluate SR matrix pellets containing 
      losartan potassium (LP) solid dispersion using extrusion-spheronization technique 
      to minimize the fluctuation of its plasma concentration. LP solid dispersions 
      were prepared by using different hydrophobic polymers at different weight ratios 
      (0.5, 1, 2, and 5%). LP-Eudragit RS solid dispersion at 1:5 ratio resulted in 
      slower drug release (only 20% of LP was released in about 8 h). Different 
      concentrations of hydrophilic polymer, PEG 6000, were mixed with Avicel(®) PH 101 
      to prepare the LP SR matrix pellets containing solid dispersion using 3(2) full 
      factorial design to evaluate the effects of formulation parameters on the pellets 
      attributes. The magnitude of torque for the pellet wet masses and binder ratio 
      were decreased significantly with increasing PEG 6000 concentration. LP sustained 
      release pellet formula composed of 9.24% PEG 6000 and 8 × 10(-9)% PVP K30 
      solution was chosen as optimized formula. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that 
      calculated t (max) was 9.72 ± 2.22 h from the optimized sustained release pellets 
      compared to 2.11 ± 0.49 h in case of Cozaar(®) immediate release tablet, 
      indicating a slower release of the LP from pellets.

TI  - Losartan: a review of its use, with special focus on elderly patients.
PG  - 227-50
AB  - Losartan is an orally active, nonpeptide, selective angiotensin subtype 1 (AT1) 
      receptor antagonist. It provides a more specific and complete blockade of the 
      actions of angiotensin II than renin or ACE inhibitors. Short term (up to 12 
      weeks' duration) clinical trials have shown losartan to be as effective at 
      lowering blood pressure (BP) [causes a decrease in BP < or = 26/20 mm Hg] in 
      elderly patients with hypertension as recommended dosages of captopril, atenolol, 
      enalapril, felodipine and nifedipine. In patients with isolated systolic 
      hypertension (ISH) the efficacy of losartan was similar to that of atenolol. The 
      addition of hydrochlorothiazide to losartan therapy provides greater 
      antihypertensive efficacy, equivalent to that seen with captopril plus 
      hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary evidence also indicates that losartan therapy 
      contributes to the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with 
      chronic hypertension. Exercise capacity is increased by losartan in patients with 
      either asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure. Results from the Losartan Heart 
      Failure Survival or ELITE II (Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly II) study 
      indicate that there was no statistically significant difference between losartan 
      and captopril in reducing overall deaths or in reducing sudden cardiac death 
      and/or resuscitated cardiac arrest in patients with heart failure. Other than 
      ELITE II, little conclusive long term mortality and morbidity data exist for 
      losartan. Additional long term trials to evaluate the survival benefits of 
      losartan in elderly patients with hypertension, renal disease or after an acute 
      myocardial infarction are currently in progress. In elderly patients with 
      hypertension, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated with 
      once daily losartan (alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) [19 to 
      27%] was similar to felodipine (23%) and nifedipine (21%), however, losartan 
      tended to be better tolerated than captopril (11 vs 16%). Losartan was also 
      better tolerated than atenolol in patients with ISH (10.4 vs 23%). In patients 
      with heart failure the renal tolerability of losartan was similar to that of 
      captopril, but losartan was associated with a lower withdrawal rate because of 
      adverse events. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly or in patients with 
      mild to moderate renal dysfunction, and the risk of first-dose hypotension is 
      low. CONCLUSIONS: comparative data have shown losartan to be as effective as 
      other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of elderly patients with 
      hypertension. Treatment with losartan is therefore an option for first-line 
      therapy in all patients with hypertension, particularly those who are not well 
      managed with or who are intolerant of their current therapy. Morbidity and 
      mortality data from the Losartan Heart Failure Survival (ELITE II) study show 
      that losartan has potential in the treatment of heart failure.

TI  - Rationale and design of a trial evaluating the effects of losartan vs. nebivolol 
      vs. the association of both on the progression of aortic root dilation in Marfan 
      syndrome with FBN1 gene mutations.
PG  - 354-62
LID - 10.2459/JCM.0b013e3283232a45 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major clinical problem of Marfan syndrome (MFS) is the aortic 
      root aneurysm, with risk of dissection when the root diameter approximates 5 cm. 
      In MFS, a key molecule, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), normally 
      bound to the extracellular matrix, is free and activated. In an experimental 
      setting, TGF-beta blockade prevents the aortic root structural damage and 
      dilatation. The angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (sartanics) exert an 
      anti-TGF-beta effect; trials are now ongoing for evaluating the effect of 
      losartan compared with atenolol in MFS. beta-Adrenergic blockers are the drugs 
      most commonly used in MFS. The third-generation beta-adrenergic blocker nebivolol 
      retains the beta-adrenergic blocker effects on heart rate and further exerts 
      antistiffness effects, typically increased in MFS. METHODS: The open-label phase 
      III study will include 291 patients with MFS and proven FBN1 gene mutations, with 
      aortic root dilation (z-score > or =2.5). The patients will be randomized to 
      nebivolol, losartan and the combination of the two drugs. The primary end point 
      is the comparative evaluation of the effects of losartan, nebivolol and the 
      association of both on the progression of aortic root growth rate. Secondary end 
      points include the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs, comparative evaluation of 
      serum levels of total and active TGF-beta, quantitative assessment of the 
      expression of the mutated gene (FBN1, both 5' and 3'), pharmacogenetic bases of 
      drug responsiveness. The quality of life evaluation in the three groups will be 
      assessed. Statistical evaluation includes an interim analysis at month 24 and 
      conclusive analyses at month 48. CONCLUSION: The present study will add 
      information about pharmacological therapy in MFS, supporting the new application 
      of angiotensin receptor 1 blockers and finding beta-adrenergic blockers that may 
      give more specific effects. Moreover, the study will further deepen understanding 
      of the pathogenetic mechanisms that are active in Marfan syndrome through the 
      pharmacogenomic and transcriptomic mechanisms that may explain MFS phenotype 
      variability.

TI  - Formulation and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Ethyl Cellulose/HPMC-Based Oral 
      Expandable Sustained Release Dosage of Losartan Potassium.
PG  - 160
LID - 10.1208/s12249-022-02295-9 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged retention of losartan potassium in the upper gastrointestinal tract is 
      anticipated to increase its absorption and exposure to CYP450 enzyme subfamilies, 
      undertaking its conversion to more potent (10-40 times) active metabolite, 
      losartan carboxylic acid (LCA). Consistent with this, hydroxypropyl 
      methylcellulose K4M/ethyl cellulose-based novel expandable films (EFs) containing 
      losartan potassium (LP) suitable for prolonged retention in the stomach were 
      developed. The films were prepared by solvent casting method. USP type II 
      dissolution apparatus (0.1 N HCl, 37°C, 100 rpm) was used to perform the 
      dissolution testing (drug release, unfolding behavior, film integrity, erosion, 
      and water uptake) of the films. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were carried out 
      in rabbits. An HPLC-UV method was used for the quantification of the drug and its 
      active metabolite in plasma. These folded films placed inside hard gelatin 
      capsule shells unfolded to full dimensions in dissolution medium and provided 
      sustained drug release throughout 12 h. The plasma drug concentration-time curves 
      obtained from the in vivo studies were used to determine pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, such as area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC), 
      area under first moment curve (AUMC), mean residence time (MRT), C(max), T(max), 
      t(1/2), k(e), and F(r) in comparison with that of the market formulation, 
      Cozaar(®). The novel EFs significantly changed the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      the drug and its active metabolite. The apparent elimination rate constant (k(e)) 
      significantly decreased, while MRT and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) increased 
      in both cases. The relative bioavailabilities (F(r)) of both LP and E3174 using 
      the novel formulation were higher than that of Cozaar(®).

TI  - Phenobarbital minimally alters plasma concentrations of losartan and its active 
      metabolite E-3174.
PG  - 268-74
AB  - Losartan, a selective angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonist for hypertension, 
      is metabolized to an active carboxylic acid metabolite, E-3174, which has a 
      longer half-life. To investigate the effects of induction of cytochrome P450 on 
      the metabolism of losartan, we evaluated the effects of phenobarbital on the 
      plasma profiles of losartan and E-3174 in 15 healthy male subjects. Ten subjects 
      received a single 100 mg oral dose of losartan before and during phenobarbital 
      administration (100 mg/day for 16 days), and five subjects received losartan 
      before and during placebo. Urinary excretion of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol (relative 
      to 17-hydroxycorticosteroids) was measured as an endogenous marker of cytochrome 
      P450 induction. The geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      ratios (with/without phenobarbital and 90% confidence intervals) for losartan and 
      its metabolite (E-3174) were 0.795 (0.723, 0.875) and 0.799 (0.778, 0.820), 
      respectively, indicating that phenobarbital treatment significantly but to a 
      clinically minor extent reduced plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174 
      (p<0.01). Half-life values of losartan and E-3174 were unchanged. The ratio of 
      6-beta-hydroxycortisol to 17-hydroxycorticosteroids doubled in the phenobarbital 
      group (p < 0.001) and did not change appreciably in the placebo group.

TI  - In Vitro Investigation of the Interaction of Tolbutamide and Losartan with Human 
      Serum Albumin in Hyperglycemia States.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22122249 [doi]

AB  - Serum albumin is exposed to numerous structural modifications which affect its 
      stability and activity. Glycation is one of the processes leading to the loss of 
      the original properties of the albumin and physiological function disorder. In 
      terms of long lasting states of the hyperglycemia, Advanced Glycation 
      End-products (AGEs) are formed. AGEs are responsible for cellular and tissue 
      structure damage that cause the appearance of a number of health consequences and 
      premature aging. The aim of the present study was to analyze the conformational 
      changes of serum albumin by glycation-"fructation"-using multiple spectroscopic 
      techniques, such as absorption (UV-Vis), fluorescence (SFM), circular dichroism 
      (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and evaluate of possible 
      alteration of binding and competition between tolbutamide (TB, a first-generation 
      sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic drug) and losartan (LOS, an angiotensin II 
      receptor (AT₁) blocker used in hypertension (1st line with a coexisting 
      diabetes)) in binding to non-glycated (HSA) and glycated (gHSA(FRC)) human serum 
      albumin in high-affinity binding sites. The studies allowed us to indicate the 
      structural alterations of human serum albumin as a result of fructose glycation. 
      Changes in binding parameters, such as association ( K a ) or Stern-Volmer ( K S 
      V ) constants suggest that glycation increases the affinity of TB and LOS towards 
      albumin and affects interactions between them. The process of albumin glycation 
      influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs, thus monitored pharmacotherapy is 
      reasonable in the case of diabetes and hypertension polypharmacy. This 
      information may lead to the development of more effective drug treatments based 
      on personalized medicine for patients with diabetes. Our studies suggest the 
      validity of monitored polypharmacy of diabetes and coexisting diseases.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of two angiotensin II receptor antagonists, irbesartan and 
      losartan in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Irbesartan/Losartan Study 
      Investigators.
PG  - 445-53
AB  - The primary objectives of this double-blind study were to compare the 
      antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of irbesartan and losartan, two 
      angiotensin II (AT1 subtype) receptor antagonists with different pharmacokinetic 
      profiles in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Both drugs are approved 
      for once-daily use (although losartan may also be prescribed twice-daily). After 
      a placebo lead-in, 567 patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily therapy 
      with placebo, 100 mg losartan, 150 mg irbesartan, or 300 mg irbesartan for 8 
      weeks. Treatment groups had comparable demographic and baseline characteristics. 
      After 8 weeks of treatment, reductions from baseline in trough seated diastolic 
      blood pressure (SeDBP) and trough seated systolic blood pressure (SeSBP) with 300 
      mg irbesartan were greater than with 100 mg losartan (P < .01 for both 
      comparisons), by 3.0 and 5.1 mm Hg, respectively; larger reductions were also 
      demonstrated at weeks 1 and 4 (P < .01 and P = .017, respectively, for SeDBP). 
      Throughout the study, the antihypertensive effect of 150 mg irbesartan did not 
      differ significantly from that of 100 mg losartan. All therapies were well 
      tolerated. The 300 mg dose of irbesartan was associated with the lowest incidence 
      of adverse events (AE) and discontinuations because of AE. This study 
      demonstrates that the maximally effective once-daily doses of two different AT1 
      receptor antagonists may result in clinically significant differences in blood 
      pressure reductions, and therefore highlights the potential importance of the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between these two members of this 
      class.

AB  - The limitations of silica-based sorbents boosted the development of new 
      extraction phases. In this study, boron nitride nanotubes functionalized with 
      octadecyl groups were used for the first time as sorbent for extraction of 
      losartan and valsartan, the most used angiotensin receptor blockers in the 
      clinical practice, from human plasma. The nanotubes were synthesized using the 
      chemical vapor deposition technique, purified by acid treatment, functionalized 
      with octadecylamine in a microwave reactor, and characterized by different 
      techniques. The functionalized nanotubes were packed in solid phase extraction 
      cartridges. Extraction conditions were optimized by means of a 2(3) factorial 
      design with center points. The separation was performed on a biphenyl core-shell 
      (100 × 4.6 mm; 2.6 µm) column, using 0.1 % (v/v) triethylamine solution and 
      methanol (pH 3.2) as mobile phase, at 0.7 mL/min, in gradient elution. The 
      injection volume was 10 µL and fluorescence detection was performed at excitation 
      and emission wavelengths of 250 and 375 nm, respectively. The developed method 
      was validated according to Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), United 
      States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
      guidelines and presented selectivity, precision, accuracy, and linearity in the 
      concentration ranges of 50-1200 ng/mL for losartan and 20-1700 ng/mL for 
      valsartan. Recoveries higher than 80 % were obtained. The method was fit for the 
      quantification of losartan in plasma samples from patients under antihypertensive 
      therapy, being useful in therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacokinetics and 
      bioequivalence studies.

TI  - Effects of a fenofibrate/losartan combination on the plasma concentration and 
      urinary excretion of purine bases.
PG  - 22-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a combination of fenofibrate and losartan on 
      the plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of purine bases in healthy male 
      subjects. METHODS: 5 healthy males participated in a fenofibrate plus losartan 
      combination study. The plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of purine 
      bases (hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid) were measured before and after 
      administrations of losartan (100 mg o.d.) alone for 2 weeks, losartan and 
      fenofibrate together for 2 weeks and fenofibrate (300 mg o.d.) alone for 2 weeks, 
      which were given consecutively over a 6-week period. RESULTS: Losartan alone 
      significantly reduced the serum uric acid concentration and increased uric acid 
      excretion, whereas the combination of losartan and fenofibrate reduced serum uric 
      acid concentrations further with a concomitant increased uric acid excretion. 
      Fenofibrate alone also reduced plasma uric acid concentration with an increase in 
      urinary excretion, although the effect was weak when compared with the 
      combination treatment. The plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of 
      oxypurines remained unchanged throughout the entire study. CONCLUSION: A 
      combination of fenofibrate and losartan demonstrated an additive urate-lowering 
      effect which may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with gout and 
      hypertriglyceridemia.

TI  - Toxicokinetic analysis of losartan during gestation and lactation in the rat.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Previous developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in rats with losartan, a 
      potent AT1-selective angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, correlated 
      maternal treatment during gestation day (GD) 15-20 with irreversible renal 
      abnormalities in the F1 generation (Spence et al., '95a,b). Continued treatment 
      through lactation was also associated with increases in pup mortality and 
      decreases in pup body weights that persisted through weaning. The studies 
      presented here were undertaken to quantify fetal and neonatal exposure to 
      losartan when administered to the dam by oral gavage during early gestation, late 
      gestation, and lactation. Following daily oral dosing of 135 mg/kg/day on GD6-15, 
      fetal drug levels were negligible. However, losartan and its active metabolite, 
      EXP3174 (L-158,641) were readily detectable in fetal plasma on GD 20 (estimated 
      AUC values, 50.70 and 167.70 micrograms/hr/ml, respectively) and maternal milk 
      during lactation (1.61 and 1.67 micrograms/ml, respectively). These studies 
      suggest that the relative increased sensitivity of the fetus as compared to the 
      neonate for losartan-induced renal lesions is related to the degree of exposure 
      which is dependent on the time of administration (early gestation vs. late 
      gestation/lactation) and the route of exposure (transplacental or through the 
      milk). Furthermore, the maximum exposure to losartan and EXP3174 correlates with 
      the ontogeny of the renin angiotensin system on approximately GD 17 and the 
      critical period for losartan-induced renal lesions (GD15-20). The data support 
      the hypothesis that the observed adverse fetal and neonatal effects are 
      pharmacologically mediated, presumably through the lack of AT1 receptor 
      stimulation.

TI  - Pharmacophore, drug metabolism, and pharmacokinetics models on non-peptide AT1, 
      AT2, and AT1/AT2 angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
PG  - 4389-99
AB  - About 20 non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists are in various stages of 
      clinical development. Different modeling approaches were used to predict the 
      pharmacophoric requirements for AT(1) (angiotensin II receptor subtype 1) 
      affinity. However, to our knowledge, none was used to predict both the 
      selectivity toward AT(1) and AT(2) (angiotensin II receptor subtype 2) receptor 
      subtypes. In this paper, partial least squares discriminant analysis is applied 
      to derive the chemical features guiding AT(1) and AT(2) selectivity or mixed 
      AT(1)/AT(2) receptor binding. The method can be used to modulate AT(1) versus 
      AT(2) selectivity. Concerns that unopposed stimulation of the AT(2) receptor 
      might produce adverse effects initiated a search for new balanced antagonists. 
      Moreover, it can serve as a fast filtering procedure in database searches. 
      Finally, some relevant pharmacokinetics and metabolic properties of the database 
      of 53 compounds are calculated using the VolSurf and MetaSite software to allow 
      the simultaneous characterization of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics 
      properties of the chemical space of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of DuP 532, a non-peptide angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonist, in rats and dogs.
PG  - 53-63
AB  - DuP 532, 2-propyl-4-pentafluoroethyl-1-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biph eny 
      l-4-]methyl) imidazole-5-carboxylic acid, is an orally active, non-peptide 
      angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist. DuP 532 is more potent and longer 
      acting than losartan, another AII receptor antagonist currently undergoing phase 
      III clinical trials. The pharmacokinetics and the effect of the salt form on the 
      bioavailability of DuP 532 were determined in rats and dogs. In rats, the 
      absolute oral bioavailability and half-life averaged 8.0% and 3.5 h, 
      respectively, after the sodium bicarbonate solution and 7.6% and 3.6 h, 
      respectively, after the methyl cellulose suspension. In dogs, the absolute oral 
      bioavailability averaged 13.4% after the sodium bicarbonate solution and 11.9% 
      after hard gelatin capsules containing the neat powder. The data demonstrated 
      that there were no differences in bioavailability between the free acid and the 
      sodium salt of DuP 532 after oral administration to rats and dogs. The in vitro 
      metabolism of 14C-DuP 532 was evaluated with rat, dog, and human liver 
      microsomes. HPLC analyses with UV and radiochemical flow detection showed that 
      recovery of DuP 532 was greater than 99%, suggesting that there was little if any 
      metabolism by liver microsomal enzymes. Therefore, the low oral bioavailability 
      in rats was probably due to poor absorption of DuP 532 from the GI tract rather 
      than extensive metabolism.

TI  - The effects of fluvastatin, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, on losartan pharmacokinetics in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 418-24
AB  - Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that is metabolized by CYP2C9 
      and CYP3A4 to a more potent antihypertensive metabolite, E3174. Interaction 
      studies with inhibitors of CYP3A4 have not demonstrated significant changes in 
      the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E3174. The authors assessed the steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174 when administered alone and concomitantly 
      with fluvastatin, a specific CYP2C9 inhibitor. A prospective, open-label, 
      crossover study was conducted in 12 healthy volunteers with losartan alone and in 
      combination with fluvastatin. The baseline phase was 7 days of losartan (50 mg 
      QAM), and the inhibition phase was 14 total days of fluvastatin (40 mg QHS), with 
      the final 7 days including losartan. The authors found that fluvastatin did not 
      significantly change the steady-state AUC0-24 or half-life of losartan or E3174. 
      Losartan apparent oral clearance was not affected by fluvastatin. Inhibition of 
      losartan metabolism appears to require both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibition.

TI  - Development of swelling/floating gastroretentive drug delivery system based on a 
      combination of hydroxyethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose for 
      Losartan and its clinical relevance in healthy volunteers with CYP2C9 
      polymorphism.
PG  - 82-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ejps.2009.10.015 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an optimal gastroretentive drug delivery 
      system (GRDDS) for administering Losartan. Additionally, the influence of 
      optimized GRDDS on the bioavailability of Losartan and the formation extent of 
      active metabolite E3174 by CYP2C9 polymorphism was investigated. Swellable and 
      floatable GRDDS tablets combining hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), sodium 
      carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC), and sodium bicarbonate were prepared at various 
      compression pressures for evaluating swelling characteristics and floating 
      capacity. Then Losartan was incorporated into optimized formulations for in vitro 
      and in vivo characterizations. An appropriate ratio of HEC to NaCMC, addition of 
      sodium bicarbonate, and compression at lower pressures resulted in the tablets 
      floating over SGF for more than 16 h and swelling to 2 cm in diameter within 3h. 
      The release patterns of Losartan from these tablets were pH-dependent. Results of 
      the clinical trials showed that the mean bioavailability from GRD-A (HEC 91.67%, 
      sodium bicarbonate 3.33% and Losartan 8.33%) was approximately 164%, relative to 
      the immediate-release product (Cozaar). MRT and t(max) values were greater and 
      C(max) values were lower for the GRDDS tablets compared with Cozaa. The lower 
      bioavailability of Losartan in the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects than CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects 
      was found and could be due to the variety of enzymatic activity.

TI  - Determinants of steady-state torasemide pharmacokinetics: impact of 
      pharmacogenetic factors, gender and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
PG  - 323-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torasemide is frequently used for the treatment of hypertension and 
      heart failure. However, the determinants of torasemide pharmacokinetics in 
      patients during steady-state conditions are largely unknown. We therefore 
      explored the impact of genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 
      (CYP2C9) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (SLCO1B1), gender, 
      and the effects of losartan and irbesartan comedication on the interindividual 
      variability of steady-state pharmacokinetics of torasemide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Twenty-four patients receiving stable medication with torasemide 10 mg once daily 
      and with an indication for additional angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) 
      treatment to control hypertension or to treat heart failure were selected. Blood 
      samples were taken before torasemide administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 
      24 hours after administration. After this first study period, patients received 
      either irbesartan 150 mg (five female and seven male patients aged 69+/-8 years) 
      or losartan 100 mg (two female and ten male patients aged 61+/-8 years) once 
      daily. After 3 days of ARB medication, eight blood samples were again collected 
      at the timepoints indicated above. The patients' long-term medications, which did 
      not include known CYP2C9 inhibitors, were maintained at a constant dose during 
      the study. All patients were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*1/*1 [n=15]; *1/*2 [n = 4]; 
      *1/*3 [n=5]) as well as for SLCO1B1 (c.521TT [n=13]; c.521TC [n=11]). RESULTS: 
      Factorial ANOVA revealed an independent impact of the CYP2C9 genotype 
      (dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the 
      24-hour dosing interval at steady state [AUC(24,ss)/D]: *1/*1 375.5+/-151.4 
      microg x h/L/mg vs *1/*3 548.5+/-271.6 microg x h/L/mg, p=0.001), the SLCO1B1 
      genotype (AUC(24,ss)/D: TT 352.3+/-114 microg x h/L/mg vs TC 487.6+/-218.4 microg 
      x h/L/mg, p<0.05) and gender (AUC(24,ss)/D: males 359.5+/-72.2 microg x h/L/mg vs 
      females 547.3+/-284 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.01) on disposition of torasemide. 
      Coadministration of irbesartan caused a 13% increase in the AUC(24,ss)/D of 
      torasemide (p=0.002), whereas losartan had no effect. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that the CYP2C9*3 and SLCO1B1 c.521TC genotype and female gender are 
      significant and independent predictors of the pharmacokinetics of torasemide. 
      Coadministration of irbesartan yields moderate but significant increases in the 
      torasemide plasma concentration and elimination half-life.

TI  - Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery influenced pharmacokinetics of 
      several drugs given as a cocktail with the highest impact observed for CYP1A2, 
      CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 substrates.
PG  - 123-132

AB  - There is a lack of information about the changes in drug pharmacokinetics and 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism after bariatric surgery. Here, we investigated 
      the effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery on 
      pharmacokinetics of nine drugs given simultaneously which may reveal changes in 
      the activities of the main CYPs. Eight obese subjects undergoing LRYGB received 
      an oral cocktail containing nine drugs, substrates of various CYPs: melatonin 
      (CYP1A2), nicotine (CYP2A6), bupropion (CYP2B6), repaglinide (CYP2C8), losartan 
      (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19/CYP3A4), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone 
      (CYP2E1) and midazolam (CYP3A). The 6-hours pharmacokinetic profiles in serum and 
      urine of each drug or corresponding metabolite as well as their metabolic ratios 
      were compared before surgery with those at a median 1 year later. LRYGB exerted 
      variable effects on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The geometric mean 
      AUC(0-6) (90% confidence interval) of melatonin, bupropion, repaglinide, 
      chlorzoxazone and midazolam after LRYGB was 27 (19%-41%), 54 (43%-67%), 44 
      (29%-66%), 160 (129%-197%) and 74 (62%-90%) of the pre-surgery values, 
      respectively. The pharmacokinetics of losartan, omeprazole and dextromethorphan 
      did not change in response to surgery. Nicotine was not detected in serum, while 
      geometric mean of AUC(0-6) of its metabolite, cotinine, increased by 1.7 times 
      after surgery. There were 3.6- and 1.3-fold increases in the AUC ratios of 
      6-hydroxymelatonin/melatonin and hydroxybupropion/bupropion, respectively. The 
      cocktail revealed multiple pharmacokinetic changes occurring after LRYGB with the 
      greatest effects observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 substrates. Future 
      studies should be focused on CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 to clarify the 
      changes in activities of these enzymes after LRYGB.

TI  - Modelling gastric emptying: A pharmacokinetic model simultaneously describing 
      distribution of losartan and its active metabolite EXP-3174.
PG  - 193-202
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13321 [doi]
AB  - Losartan presents multiple peaks in the concentration-time profile. This 
      characteristic can be attributed to gastric emptying, which is known to 
      significantly affect the disposition of highly soluble and permeable compounds. 
      The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for 
      losartan and its active metabolite (EXP-3174) in order to describe the effect of 
      gastric emptying on their disposition. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was 
      performed using concentration-time data derived from a crossover bioequivalence 
      study in 31 volunteers after a single oral dose of 100 mg losartan potassium in 
      the fasted state. Delay differential equations (DDEs) were explored for the 
      description of losartan absorption and EXP-3174 formation, since when solved they 
      result in oscillatory behaviour. A two-compartment model preceded by a 
      pre-absorption compartment (referring to small intestine) adequately described 
      the observed concentration-time profiles of losartan. In the final model, a 
      sinusoidal equation was used for the description of gastric emptying in view of 
      its simplicity, leading to enhanced stability of the model and its capacity to 
      describe periodicity. In case of EXP-3174, a one-compartment model, with a 
      delayed first-order formation rate from losartan's central compartment, best 
      described its disposition. Using the model developed, it was shown through 
      simulations that changes in gastric emptying parameters lead to changes in the 
      C-t profiles of both compounds. In particular, plasma oscillations can be 
      enhanced or completely suppressed, simply by changing parameters affecting 
      gastric emptying.

TI  - Computational Simulations to Guide Enzyme-Mediated Prodrug Activation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21103621 [doi]
LID - 3621
AB  - Prodrugs are designed to improve pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical 
      characteristics, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, site-specificity, 
      and more. A crucial step in successful prodrug is its activation, which releases 
      the active parent drug, exerting a therapeutic effect. Prodrug activation can be 
      based on oxidation/reduction processes, or through enzyme-mediated hydrolysis, 
      from oxidoreductases (i.e., Cytochrome P450) to hydrolytic enzymes (i.e., 
      carboxylesterase). This study provides an overview of the novel in silico methods 
      for the optimization of enzyme-mediated prodrug activation. Computational methods 
      simulating enzyme-substrate binding can be simpler like molecular docking, or 
      more complex, such as quantum mechanics (QM), molecular mechanics (MM), and free 
      energy perturbation (FEP) methods such as molecular dynamics (MD). Examples for 
      MD simulations used for elucidating the mechanism of prodrug (losartan, 
      paclitaxel derivatives) metabolism via CYP450 enzyme are presented, as well as an 
      MD simulation for optimizing linker length in phospholipid-based prodrugs. 
      Molecular docking investigating quinazolinone prodrugs as substrates for alkaline 
      phosphatase is also presented, as well as QM and MD simulations used for optimal 
      fit of different prodrugs within the human carboxylesterase 1 catalytical site. 
      Overall, high quality computational simulations may show good agreement with 
      experimental results, and should be used early in the prodrug development 
      process.

TI  - Pre-treatment with curcumin enhances plasma concentrations of losartan and its 
      metabolite EXP3174 in rats.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - The study was carried out in the Wistar rats to investigate the effect of 
      curcumin pre-treatment on the pharmacokinetics of the hypertension-treating drug 
      losartan and its metabolite EXP3174 following single oral administration. In the 
      treatment group, rats were gavaged with losartan 10 mg/kg after repeat oral doses 
      of curcumin (100 mg/kg, for 7 d), while rats in the control group were 
      administrated only with the same dose losartan. The results showed that curcumin 
      significantly increased the plasma concentrations of losartan and its metabolite 
      EXP3174. The present study implicated the existence of herb-drug interaction 
      between curcumin and losartan, and further evaluation of the possible interaction 
      during curcumin administration needs to be considered.

TI  - Effects of the CYP2C9*13 allele on the pharmacokinetics of losartan in healthy 
      male subjects.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of losartan in 
      relation to the CYP2C9*13 allele. A single oral dose of 50 mg losartan was 
      administrated to each of the 16 healthy male volunteers with a different genotype 
      (CYP2C9*1/*1, n = 6; CYP2C9*1/*13, n = 4; and CYP2C9*1/*3, n = 6). Blood samples 
      were collected from pre-dose up to 24 h after the drug administration. Plasma 
      losartan and E3174 (an active metabolite of losartan) were assayed by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All the subjects finished the 
      study without adverse drug effects. In the present study, the frequencies of 
      CYP2C9*13 and *13 alleles were 0.6% and 2.6% in Chinese healthy volunteers, 
      respectively, and both alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with 
      the subjects in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group, individuals carrying the CYP2C9*1/*13 
      genotype showed significantly a longer t(1/2) of losartan and E3174 and markedly 
      increased the area under the curve (AUC) of losartan. Meanwhile, the CYP2C9*1/*3 
      genotype group had significant differences in t(1/2) and Cmax of E3174 compared 
      with the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The ratio of AUC(E3174)/AUC(losartan) after losartan 
      administration in the CYP2C9*1/*13 and CYP2C9*1/*3 groups was also statistically 
      different from that in the CYP2C9*1/*1 group. The data indicate that the presence 
      of the CYP2C9*13 allele results in poor metabolism of losartan after a single 
      oral dose.

TI  - Absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between losartan and 
      hydrochlorothiazide.
PG  - 1200-6
AB  - To support the use of a combination of losartan, a highly specific and selective 
      AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of 
      hypertension, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study was conducted. In this 
      open-label, randomized, three-period, crossover study, patients with mild to 
      moderate hypertension received a 12.5-mg tablet of hydrochlorothiazide, a 50-mg 
      losartan tablet, or a combination tablet of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 50 
      mg of losartan for 7 days. Twelve patients (age range, 35-55 years; mean age, 44 
      years) were allocated to treatment. Drug interactions were evaluated by comparing 
      the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for losartan and its 
      active metabolite, E-3174, when losartan (50 mg) was given alone or in 
      combination with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. The urinary recovery over the 
      24-hour period of hydrochlorothiazide was compared for hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 
      mg) given alone or in combination with 50 mg losartan. A clinically significant 
      interaction was defined as a treatment difference of more than 35%. There was no 
      evidence of a clinically significant effect of hydrochlorothiazide on the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174, as the geometric mean AUC24 ratio (90% 
      confidence interval [CI]) was 1.02 (0.95, 1.09) for losartan and 1.02 (0.96, 
      1.09) for E-3174. Based on urinary recovery over a 24-hour period of 
      hydrochlorothiazide, losartan did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
      hydrochlorothiazide, as the geometric mean ratio of urinary hydrochlorothiazide 
      recovery (90% CI) was 0.898 (0.79, 1.20). There was a minor (17%) decrease in the 
      AUC24 of hydrochlorothiazide after administration of the combination tablet. 
      Coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and losartan was well tolerated.

TI  - Effect of multiple doses of losartan on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of 
      digoxin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 571-5
AB  - 1. Losartan (DuP 753, MK-954) is a novel, potent and highly selective AT1 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The effect of multiple oral doses of losartan 
      on digoxin pharmacokinetics was evaluated in healthy male subjects. 2. In a 
      double-blind and randomized fashion, subjects received 50 mg losartan or placebo 
      once daily for 15 days in each period. At least 7 days elapsed between the two 
      treatment periods. On days 4 and 11 of each period, subjects also received a 
      single 0.5 mg dose of digoxin intravenously and orally respectively. 3. Eleven of 
      13 subjects completed the study. Side effects were mild and transient (12 out of 
      13 subjects reported at least one adverse experience). During the study, no 
      laboratory abnormalities were noted. 4. Multiple oral doses of losartan (50 mg 
      daily) did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of 0.5 mg of digoxin i.v. 
      AUC(0.48h) of immunoreactive digoxin during losartan 28.8 +/- 2.9 vs 28.5 +/- 3.9 
      ng ml-1 h during placebo; not significant, and 96 h urinary excretion [% dose] 
      during losartan 54.0 +/- 7.2 vs 51.9 +/- 6.5% during placebo; not significant). 
      Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC and urinary excretion 
      were respectively, 1.03 (0.98, 1.08) and 1.09 (0.98, 1.21). 5. Multiple oral 
      doses of losartan did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of oral digoxin 
      AUC(0.48 h) during losartan 23.6 +/- 3.7 ng ml-1 h vs 22.4 +/- 2.6 ng ml-1 h 
      during placebo; not significant, Cmax 3.5 +/- 0.7 ng ml-1 with vs 3.1 +/- 0.5 ng 
      ml-1 without losartan; not significant and tmax 0.6 +/- 0.2 h with vs 0.9 +/- 0.7 
      h without losartan; not significant, and 96 h urinary excretion [% dose] during 
      losartan 51.2 +/- 6.3 vs 46.3 +/- 2.4% during placebo; not significant). 
      Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC and urinary excretion 
      were respectively, 1.06 (0.98, 1.14) and 1.12 (0.97, 1.28). 6. We conclude that 
      multiple oral doses of losartan (50 mg daily) do not alter the pharmacokinetics 
      of immunoreactive digoxin, following either intravenous or oral digoxin. 
      Furthermore, the co-administration of digoxin with losartan is well tolerated by 
      healthy male volunteers.

TI  - Effect of oral administration of losartan, prazosin, and verapamil on peritoneal 
      solute transport in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 576-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several intraperitoneally administered drugs have been shown to 
      modify transport of peritoneal solute and fluid. Fewer studies, however, have 
      evaluated the effect of orally administered drugs. The present study was 
      performed to evaluate the effects of oral losartan, prazosin, and verapamil on 
      peritoneal membrane transport during a peritoneal equilibration test (PET), as 
      well as the effects on creatinine clearance (CrCl), Kt/V urea, 24-hour protein in 
      drained dialysate, and drained volume. METHODS: This was an open, controlled, 
      crossover clinical trial performed in 20 patients on continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis. All subjects used four 2-L 1.5% glucose dialysis exchanges 
      per day. After a 7-day washout period (without antihypertensives), they had a 
      baseline standard PET and dialysis adequacy assessment performed. Subsequently, 
      they were randomly allocated to receive the first of three study drugs (losartan, 
      prazosin, and verapamil), which were administered orally for a 7-day period. 
      Immediately after each drug period, patients had a new 3-day washout and 
      subsequently started the next drug, until they had received each of the three 
      drugs. On the last day of administration of each drug, patients were subjected to 
      a new PET and adequacy of dialysis evaluation. RESULTS: None of the studied drugs 
      significantly modified the peritoneal transport of creatinine, glucose, urea, 
      sodium, potassium, or total protein as evaluated by PET. Verapamil significantly 
      increased peritoneal CrCl [51.3 (44.3 - 53.3) vs baseline 45.8 (41.4 - 50.5) 
      L/week/ 1.73 m2, p < 0.05], weekly Kt/V urea [1.75 (1.60 - 1.78) vs baseline 1.59 
      (1.54 - 1.73), p < 0.05], and drained dialysate volume [8.80 (8.30 - 8.96) vs 
      baseline 8.44 (8.20 - 8.50) L/day, p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of 
      losartan, prazosin, and verapamil did not modify the peritoneal transport of 
      solutes during a 4-hour PET. Oral verapamil significantly increased CrCl, Kt/V 
      urea, and 24-hour drained dialysate volume. It is most likely that verapamil 
      increases peritoneal (hydraulic) conductivity, and then net ultrafiltration 
      volume and convective transport of urea, creatinine, and protein. Verapamil could 
      be considered as an alternative in patients requiring increased dialysis dose 
      and/or ultrafiltration.

TI  - The IGF-I system and the renal and haemodynamic effects of losartan in 
      normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Losartan has been shown to protect the diabetic kidney, at least 
      partly independent of changes in blood pressure. Imbalances in the IGF-I system 
      are associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy. We investigated 
      whether renal as well as haemodynamic effects of losartan are associated with 
      changes in the IGF-I system in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This randomized, double-blind 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial involved 74 normotensive patients with T2DM and 
      microalbuminuria. Thirty-eight patients were assigned to receive losartan and 36 
      patients were assigned to receive placebo for 10 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Serum 
      levels of total and free IGF-I, IGFBP-3, creatinine and haemoglobin A(1c) 
      (HbA(1c)), as well as urinary albumin excretion rate, creatinine clearance and 
      blood pressure, were measured prior to the start of treatment and after 10 weeks 
      of treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, serum levels of IGFBP-3 were elevated and 
      serum levels of free IGF-I were reduced. Losartan tended to reduce IGFBP-3 levels 
      and to increase free IGF-I levels, although neither effect was statistically 
      significant. These effects were more pronounced in a subanalysis of 18 
      losartan-treated patients with stable metabolic parameters, with a decrease in 
      IGFBP-3 from 133.2 to 122.6 nmol/l (P=0.006) and an increase in free IGF-I levels 
      by 8% (ns). Serum levels of total IGF-I were unaffected. The change in IGFBP-3 
      was inversely correlated to the change in creatinine clearance (r=-0.4; P=0.02). 
      Total and free IGF-I inversely correlated to systolic blood pressure (r= -0.46; 
      P=0.007 and r=0.26; P=0.14 respectively). Furthermore, changes in total IGF-I and 
      IGFBP-3 correlated to changes in serum creatinine levels in the metabolically 
      stable patients (r=0.58, P=0.02 and r=0.6, P=0.01, respectively). Changes in the 
      IGF-I system were unrelated to a reduction in microalbuminuria associated with 
      losartan. CONCLUSIONS: Losartan lowered the elevated levels of IGFBP-3, although 
      only significantly in the metabolically stable patients. A tendency towards an 
      increase in free IGF-I levels was also observed, but this change was small and 
      not statistically significant. These changes were not related to reduction in 
      microalbuminuria, but might contribute to effects of losartan on creatinine 
      clearance and blood pressure of losartan in normotensive patients with T2DM.

      (PLG-g-mPEG)-cisplatin nanoparticles improves drug penetration, retention and 
      anti-tumor activity.

AB  - Intratumoral injection of chemotherapy agents may be employed in the treatment of 
      cancers. However, its anti-tumor efficacy is significantly impeded by collagen 
      fibers in the tumor which decrease drug penetration into the tumor tissues. To 
      improve the penetration, collagen inhibiting drug exposure is required. In this 
      study, microspheres were fabricated by the modified double emulsion-solvent 
      evaporation method as the drug delivery system of losartan potassium (LP MSs), 
      with 5% gelatin as the inner phase. The collagen inhibiting experiment analyzed 
      by Sirius Red stains demonstrated that LP MSs may effectively inhibit collagen I 
      synthesis in B16 tumors. In addition, 15% F127 was used as the solvent to fix the 
      formulations at the injection site, with poly (α-l-glutamate) grafted 
      polyethylene glycol mono methyl ether (PLG-g-mPEG)-cisplatin loaded nanoparticles 
      (CDDP NPs) as the model drug. The in vivo live imaging system showed that 
      formulations dissolved in 15% F127 had 54.91% CDDP NPs retained in tumors at the 
      end of 10 days, in comparison with 19.72% for those solved in water, suggesting 
      strong intratumoral retention property of the in situ gel. In addition, confocal 
      laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and Energy-Dispersive Analysis of X-ray 
      spectroscopy combined with scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDAX) tests showed 
      that LP MSs can effectively enhance the distribution and penetration of CDDP NPs 
      within tumors. Furthermore, tumors i.t. treated with LP MSs/CDDP NPs gel could be 
      significantly halted, or even reduced to 200 mm(3), comparing with a volume of 
      about 12000 mm(3) incontrol group at the end of the anti-tumor effect experiment. 
      These results provided important guiding principles for prolonged and localized 
      drug delivery system of intratumoral collagen inhibitor. The improvements of 
      intratumoral penetration method made in this study provided practical 
      significance for the treatment of cancer, especially for mass tumors.

TI  - Antihypertensive drugs in patients treated with antiretrovirals.
PG  - 703-9
LID - 10.1345/aph.1Q546 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for information regarding pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between antiretrovirals and antihypertensive agents, evaluate the 
      clinical significance of these interactions, and analyze the effect of 
      antihypertensive drugs on the metabolic complications frequently observed in 
      HIV-infected patients to emphasize the advantages and inconveniences of every 
      class of antihypertensive drugs in association with antiretrovirals. DATA 
      SOURCES: A literature search was conducted via PubMed and MEDLINE (1950-November 
      2011) using the search terms drug interactions, cytochrome P450, names of 
      antiretrovirals, names of commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs, 
      pharmacokinetics, and metabolic complications. Reference citations from relevant 
      publications, manufacturers' product information, and 
      www.HIV-druginteractions.org were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      EXTRACTIONS: All articles with an English abstract identified through the data 
      search were examined. Of these, pharmacologic reviews, studies, and case reports 
      were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Antihypertensive drugs interact with several 
      antiretroviral drugs, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and 
      protease inhibitors (PIs) in particular. Pharmacokinetic interactions are less 
      expected with diuretics, β-blockers excreted by the kidney, 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor 
      blockers (ARBs) other than losartan and irbesartan. Calcium channel blockers 
      (CCBs) are metabolized by CYP3A4, with the potential for interaction with NNRTIs 
      and PIs. Because CCBs do not adversely affect glucose or lipid metabolism or 
      renal function, they may be preferred in patients with such complications. ACE 
      inhibitors and ARBs may exert favorable effects on glucose homeostasis. In 
      addition, they may significantly reduce protein excretion and further slow the 
      progression of renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of antihypertensive drugs 
      in HIV-infected patients is complex and must take into account the metabolic 
      pathways of antiretroviral drugs and antihypertensive drugs with the potential of 
      pharmacokinetic interactions, as well as the effect of antihypertensive drugs on 
      some biological parameters.

TI  - Lack of polymorphism of the conversion of losartan to its active metabolite 
      E-3174 in extensive and poor metabolizers of debrisoquine (cytochrome P450 2D6) 
      and mephenytoin (cytochrome P450 2C19).
PG  - 279-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Losartan was given to subjects with known phenotypes of the 
      polymorphic enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to study any possible influence on the 
      metabolism of the drug. METHODS: Plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174 
      were studied after oral intake of 50 mg losartan in 24 healthy, male, Swedish 
      Caucasian subjects who were extensive or poor metabolizers (EM/PM) of 
      debrisoquine [cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6)] or mephenytoin [cytochrome P450 2C19 
      (CYP2C19)]. RESULTS: The areas under the curve (AUCinfinity) of losartan and 
      E-3174 did not differ between poor and extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine or 
      mephenytoin, respectively. CONCLUSION: About 14% of the antihypertensive drug 
      losartan is metabolized to the active carboxylic acid metabolite E-3174, which 
      contributes to the effect of losartan. The present study suggests that CYP2D6 and 
      CYP2C19 are not involved to any major extent in the in vivo conversion of 
      losartan to E-3174.

TI  - Comparison of the transplacental transfer of enalapril, captopril and losartan in 
      sheep.
PG  - 1495-501
AB  - 1. The transplacental transfers of three drugs (enalapril, captopril and 
      losartan) which block the renin angiotensin system and have different 
      lipophilicities were studied in chronically catheterized foetal sheep (125-139 
      days gestation). 2. The ability of the foeto-placental unit to convert enalapril 
      to enalaprilat was studied in two chronically catheterized foetuses. Enalapril (3 
      mg kg-1, 7.9 mumol kg-1) given i.v. to the foetuses abolished the foetal pressor 
      response to 5 micrograms angiotensin I (AI) in one foetus and attenuated the 
      pressor response in the other. 3. Enalapril (100 mg, 5.7 mumol kg-1) given i.v. 
      to the ewe (n = 5) abolished the maternal pressor response to 2.5 micrograms AI 
      (n = 1) and attenuated the maternal pressor response to 5 micrograms AI (n = 5, P 
      < 0.001). The foetal pressor response to 5 micrograms AI (n = 2) and 10 
      micrograms AI (n = 3) did not change. The maternal and foetal pressor responses 
      to angiotensin II (AII; n = 5) did not change. 4. Foetal pressor responses to 5 
      micrograms AI (n = 1) and 10 micrograms AI (n = 2) were attenuated within 11 min 
      of their mothers (n = 3) being given i.v. captopril (15 mg, 1.5 mumol kg-1). 
      Foetal pressor responses to 5 micrograms AII (n = 1) and to 10 micrograms AII (n 
      = 2) did not change. 5. Losartan (100 mg, kg-1, 21.7 mumol kg-1) given i.v. to 
      the foetus (n = 9) attenuated the foetal pressor response to 5 micrograms AII (P 
      < 0.001) but the maternal pressor response to 5 micrograms AII did not change. 6. 
      Losartan (100 mg, 21.7 MICROmol kg-1) given i.v. to the ewe (n = 5) attenuated 
      the maternal pressor response to 5 microg AII (P <0.002) but the foetal pressor 
      response to 5 microg AII did not change.7. It is concluded that the 
      foeto-placental unit of the sheep can metabolize enalapril to 
      enalaprilat.Captopril readily crosses the sheep placenta but enalapril and 
      losartan do not. Thus, the transplacental transfer of these drugs does not 
      parallel their lipid solubilities. Furthermore the results show that AT1 
      receptors are important in mediating the vasoconstrictor effects of AII in the 
      foetus.

TI  - Newly emerging pharmacologic differences in angiotensin II receptor blockers.
PG  - 18S-24S
AB  - Several angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are currently available for the 
      treatment of hypertension. These drugs share a common mechanism of 
      action-antagonism of angiotensin II AT1 receptors; however, their receptor 
      binding kinetics differ. Candesartan has a higher affinity for the AT1 receptor 
      than all the other ARB. In addition, candesartan and irbesartan block the AT1 
      receptor with insurmountable antagonism, whereas losartan, valsartan, and 
      eprosartan are competitive antagonists. The pharmacokinetics of these ARB also 
      differ in terms of oral bioavailability, rate of absorption, metabolism, and 
      route and rate of elimination. Both losartan potassium and candesartan cilexetil 
      are prodrugs; however, losartan is partially converted into EXP3174 in the liver, 
      whereas candesartan cilexetil is converted completely into candesartan during 
      gastrointestinal absorption. On the basis of elimination half-lives, losartan, 
      valsartan, and eprosartan may be classified as shorter acting and candesartan 
      cilexetil and irbesartan as longer acting. Each drug effectively lowers blood 
      pressure during once daily administration to patients with mild to moderate 
      hypertension, with candesartan cilexetil requiring the lowest dosage and 
      providing dose-dependent efficacy. Initial comparative clinical trials suggest 
      that both candesartan cilexetil and irbesartan in the doses used are 
      significantly more effective than losartan in lowering trough sitting diastolic 
      blood pressure. It remains to be determined, however, whether the observed 
      pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic differences among the members of the ARB class 
      will have a clinically significant impact on long-term cardiovascular outcomes 
      and reductions of cardiovascular mortality.

TI  - Serum Concentrations of Losartan Metabolites Correlate With Improved Physical 
      Function in a Pilot Study of Prefrail Older Adults.
PG  - 2356-2366
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glac102 [doi]
AB  - Losartan is an oral antihypertensive agent that is rapidly metabolized to EXP3174 
      (angiotensin-subtype-1-receptor blocker) and EXP3179 (peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARγ] agonist), which was shown in animal 
      studies to reduce inflammation, enhance mitochondrial energetics, and improve 
      muscle repair and physical performance. We conducted an exploratory pilot study 
      evaluating losartan treatment in prefrail older adults (age 70-90 years, N = 25). 
      Participants were randomized to control (placebo) or treatment (daily oral 
      losartan beginning at 25 mg per day and increasing every 8 weeks) for a total of 
      6 months. Fatigue, hyperkalemia, and hypotension were the most observed side 
      effects of losartan treatment. Participants in the losartan group had an 
      estimated 89% lower odds of frailty (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18% to 99% 
      lower odds, p = .03), with a 0.3-point lower frailty score than the placebo group 
      (95% CI: 0.01-0.5 lower odds, p = .04). Frailty score was also negatively 
      associated with serum losartan and EXP3179 concentrations. For every one standard 
      deviation increase in EXP3179 (ie, 0.0011 ng/μL, based on sample values above 
      detection limit) and EXP3174 (ie, 0.27 ng/μL, based on sample values above 
      detection limit), there was a 0.0035 N (95% CI: 0.0019-0.0051, p < .001) and a 
      0.0027 N (95% CI: 0.00054-0.0043, p = .007) increase in average knee strength, 
      respectively.

TI  - Comparative study of taste disturbance by losartan and perindopril in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 1319-23
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the degree of taste disturbance by losartan, 
      an angiotensin II receptor blocker, with that of perindopril, an 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Perindopril erbumine (2 mg), losartan 
      potassium (25 mg), or vehicle was given to Japanese volunteers (n = 7) for 14 
      days in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover design with a 14-day 
      washout period. Gustometry by filter-paper test and electrogustometry were 
      performed before and at the end of each trial. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and 
      serum and salivary zinc concentrations were measured. One subject dropped out 
      because of a perindopril-induced dry cough, but no one claimed a taste 
      disturbance. Detection thresholds of 4 basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, and 
      bitter) by the paper-disc test and electrogustometry were significantly worsened, 
      and plasma renin activity was elevated by the drugs, whereas the deteriorating 
      effects of 2 drugs did not significantly differ. These drugs did not affect zinc 
      concentrations in plasma and saliva. It was concluded that losartan and 
      perindopril similarly alter taste sensitivity during repeated dosing of the 
      drugs.

TI  - Repaglinide-irbesartan drug interaction: effects of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on 
      repaglinide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in Chinese population.
PG  - 1021-1028
LID - 10.1007/s00228-018-2477-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: On account of the potential inhibition of OATP1B1 (organic anion 
      transporting polypeptide) by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and the 
      effects of SLCO1B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member) 
      polymorphism, the aim of current study is to assess the impact of ARBs on the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of repaglinide in Chinese healthy 
      volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes. METHODS: The in vitro study was 
      conducted on irbesartan, valsartan, olmesartan, and losartan by using HEK293 
      cells transfected with OATP1B1. Data on drug interactions between repaglinide and 
      irbesartan from 21 healthy Chinese-Han male volunteers were collected and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: IC(50) from in vitro study suggested irbesartan was the most 
      potent inhibitor of OATP1B1 transporter. Clinical data from single dose of 
      repaglinide indicated SLCO1B1 c.521 T>C polymorphism influenced the PK and PD of 
      repaglinide in healthy Chinese-Han male volunteers. In subjects with SLCO1B1 
      c.521 TT genotype, irbesartan comedication increased the exposure of repaglinide. 
      In details, the peak plasma concentration [C(max)] increased 84% (P = 0.003) and 
      the area under the curve of plasma concentration 0-8 h [AUC(0-8)] increased 34% 
      (P = 0.004), while the minimum blood glucose concentration [C(min)] decreased 
      33.8% (P = 0.005). No significant change was observed in repaglinide exposure in 
      subjects with SLCO1B1 c.521 TC genotype in presence or absence of irbesartan. 
      CONCLUSION: SLCO1B1 c.521 T>C polymorphism affects the PK of repaglinide in 
      Chinese population. Irbesartan increased repaglinide exposure in subjects with 
      SLCO1B1 c.521 TT genotype, but not SLCO1B1 c.521 TC genotype.

TI  - The new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, irbesartan: pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic considerations.
PG  - 311S-317S
AB  - This article reviews the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of angiotensin II 
      (AII) receptor antagonists (AIIRA), with particular focus on the novel compound 
      irbesartan. Irbesartan has the highest oral bioavailability in its class (60% to 
      80%) and, unlike valsartan, its absorption is not affected by food. Irbesartan 
      displays linear, dose related pharmacokinetics and, with the exception of 
      tasosartan's active metabolite, has the longest elimination half-life of the 
      AIIRA (11 to 15 h). Irbesartan exhibits the lowest amount of protein binding, 
      limiting its potential for drug interactions. No drug interactions with 
      irbesartan have been identified. Unlike losartan, candesartan, and tasosartan, 
      irbesartan does not require biotransformation for AII blockade. The 
      pharmacokinetics of irbesartan are not altered in renally or hepatically impaired 
      patients, probably owing to excretion characteristic by both biliary and renal 
      routes, or by differences in gender or age. Within its therapeutic dose range 
      (150 to 300 mg), irbesartan shows sustained, dose related blockade 24 h after 
      dosing. Irbesartan lowers blood pressure in a dose related manner up to 300 mg 
      daily. Some clear differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics exist 
      among the AIIRA, which may have clinical implications.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of vasodilators. Part I.
PG  - 457-82
AB  - Understanding the mechanism of action and the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      vasodilatory drugs facilitates optimal use in clinical practice. It should be 
      kept in mind that a drug belongs to a class but is a distinct entity, sometimes 
      derived from a prototype to achieve a specific effect. The most common 
      pharmacokinetic drug improvement is the development of a drug with a half-life 
      sufficiently long to allow an adequate once-daily dosage. Developing a controlled 
      release preparation can increase the apparent half-life of a drug. Altering the 
      molecular structure may also increase the half-life of a prototype drug. Another 
      desirable improvement is increasing the specificity of a drug, which may result 
      in fewer adverse effects, or more efficacy at the target site. This is especially 
      important for vasodilatory drugs which may be administered over decades for the 
      treatment of hypertension, which usually does not interfere with subjective 
      well-being. Compliance is greatly increased with once-daily dosing. Vasodilatory 
      agents cause relaxation by either a decrease in cytoplasmic calcium, an increase 
      in nitric oxide (NO) or by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase. They are divided 
      into 9 classes: calcium antagonists, potassium channel openers, ACE inhibitors, 
      angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, alpha-adrenergic and imidazole receptor 
      antagonists, beta 1-adrenergic agonist, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, eicosanoids 
      and NO donors. Despite chemical differences, the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      calcium antagonists are similar. Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is 
      high, with all substances undergoing considerable first-pass metabolism by the 
      liver, resulting in low bioavailability and pronounced individual variation in 
      pharmacokinetics. Renal impairment has little effect on pharmacokinetics since 
      renal elimination of these agents is minimal. Except for the newer drugs of the 
      dihydropyridine type, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, nilvadipine, 
      nisoldipine and nitrendipine, the half-life of calcium antagonists is short. 
      Maintaining an effective drug concentration for the remainder of these agents 
      requires multiple daily dosing, in some cases even with controlled release 
      formulations. However, a coat-core preparation of nifedipine has been developed 
      to allow once-daily administration. Adverse effects are directly correlated to 
      the potency of the individual calcium antagonists. Treatment with the potassium 
      channel opener minoxidil is reserved for patients with moderately severe to 
      severe hypertension which is refractory to other treatment. Diazoxide and 
      hydralazine are chiefly used to treat severe hypertensive emergencies, primary 
      pulmonary and malignant hypertension and in severe preeclampsia. ACE inhibitors 
      prevent conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and are most effective when 
      renin production is increased. Since ACE is identical to kininase-II, which 
      inactivates the potent endogenous vasodilator bradykinin, ACE inhibition causes a 
      reduction in bradykinin degradation. ACE inhibitors exert cardioprotective and 
      cardioreparative effects by preventing and reversing cardiac fibrosis and 
      ventricular hypertrophy in animal models. The predominant elimination pathway of 
      most ACE inhibitors is via renal excretion. Therefore, renal impairment is 
      associated with reduced elimination and a dosage reduction of 25 to 50% is 
      recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Separating 
      angiotensin-II inhibition from bradykinin potentiation has been the goal in 
      developing angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. The incidence of adverse effects 
      of such an agent, losartan, is comparable to that encountered with placebo 
      treatment, and the troublesome cough associated with ACE inhibitors is absent.

TI  - Losartan metabolite EXP3179 activates Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
      via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in endothelial cells: 
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor-independent effects of EXP3179.
PG  - 1798-805
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) 
      blockers have vascular protective effects beyond blood pressure lowering. Because 
      of the importance of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in vascular and 
      platelet function, we hypothesized that losartan and its metabolites would 
      stimulate eNOS and its upstream activators Akt and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
      (PI3K). METHODS AND RESULTS: Losartan is metabolized into EXP3174 (AT1R-blocking 
      metabolite) and EXP3179 (no AT1R-blocking properties). Treatment of endothelial 
      cells (ECs) with losartan and both metabolites stimulated phosphorylation of Akt 
      and eNOS in the absence of angiotensin II. However, the magnitude for EXP3179 was 
      much greater than EXP3174, and the EC50 was significantly lower (-logEC50, 
      8.2+/-0.1 versus 5.4+/-0.2 mol/L), suggesting an AT1R-independent effect. 
      Inhibiting PI3K or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) 
      tyrosine phosphorylation abrogated EXP3179-induced eNOS phosphorylation. In 
      endothelium of intact rat aorta, EXP3179 also stimulated Akt and eNOS 
      phosphorylation. VEGFR2 activation was shown to be calcium and Src family kinase 
      dependent by use of specific drug inhibitors and dominant negative kinase 
      transfection. EXP3179 significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced 
      apoptosis by approximately 60% (from 30.1+/-5.8% to 12.2+/-2.0% TUNEL-positive 
      cells), which was abolished by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. 
      Cleaved caspase-3 was suppressed by 48% with EXP3179. CONCLUSIONS: The losartan 
      metabolite EXP3179 stimulates eNOS phosphorylation and suppresses tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha-induced EC apoptosis by activating the VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway.

TI  - Effects of the specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan on urate 
      homeostasis and intestinal urate transport.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - Possible mechanisms for the hypouricemic effects of the angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist losartan were examined using rats with experimental chronic renal 
      failure (CRF) and control animals. The results show that losartan has a 
      uricosuric effect in rats with normal or decreased renal function. Renal 
      clearance of urate was increased 3-fold in CRF rats and 2-fold in control rats 
      after 7 days of intraperitoneal losartan administration. Although the results 
      show that losartan and its metabolite EXP-3174 alter urate and Cl- transport 
      across isolated short-circuited intestine, these agents do not promote urate 
      secretion into the intestinal lumen. Unidirectional urate and Cl- fluxes were 
      reduced across normal rat colon and unaltered in the small intestine in the 
      presence of losartan. In CRF rat colon, net secretion of urate and Cl- was 
      abolished after losartan addition at 10(-5) M. Transport across the small 
      intestine of CRF rats did not change in the presence of a similar concentration 
      of drug. Losartan treatment of CRF rats before the removal of colonic tissues 
      reversed the basal net secretion of urate to net absorption. These results 
      suggest that the changes in intestinal transport observed in the presence of 
      losartan appear to be mediated via the angiotensin II receptor antagonistic 
      action of this drug. Direct determination of the effects of angiotensin II on 
      urate and Cl- transport across colonic tissues from control animals revealed a 
      significant angiotensin II stimulation of urate secretion. These angiotensin 
      II-induced alterations in transport were inhibitable by losartan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess whether angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) offer any 
      additional advantage in confirming the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA) 
      and their use in the differentiation of PA subtypes. METHODS: A prospective, 
      cohort, head-to-head study was conducted between July 2003 and July 2006. A total 
      of 135 patients received captopril and losartan tests to confirm the diagnosis of 
      PA in the TAIPAI (Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism Investigation) intervention. 
      RESULTS: In total, 71 patients were diagnosed with PA. The area under the 
      receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the postcaptopril plasma 
      aldosterone concentration (PAC) was significantly less than that of the 
      postlosartan PAC (0.744 vs. 0.829, P = 0.038). Using an aldosterone-renin ratio 
      (ARR, ng/dl per ng/ml/h) >35 with a PAC >10 ng/dl, the specificity was 89.1% vs. 
      93.8% and the sensitivity was 66.2% vs. 84.5 % for the captopril test vs. the 
      losartan test, respectively. With respect to the losartan test, the accuracy was 
      88.9%, the agreement was good (k = 0.778), and there was no disagreement with the 
      McNemar test (P = 0.118). Losartan had the advantage of a better negative 
      predictive value to exclude PA when patients were referred with a serum potassium 
      (SK) level <3.8 mmol/l. When a postlosartan ARR >60 was the cutoff value, the 
      positive predictive value was 82% with a negative predictive value of 57% in 
      distinguishing aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) from idiopathic 
      hyperaldosteronism (IHA). CONCLUSIONS: The postlosartan ARR and PAC were shown to 
      have better accuracy for the diagnosis of PA than the captopril test. With a 
      postlosartan ARR >60, APAs can be adequately differentiated from IHA.

TI  - Effect of experimental renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of losartan in rats.
PG  - 1077-83
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the pharmacokinetics 
      of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan is altered in renal failure. 
      Male Wistar rats were pretreated with uranyl nitrate or subjected to bilateral 
      ureteral ligation to produce acute renal failure (ARF). Saline-injected and 
      sham-operated rats, respectively, served as controls. Uranyl nitrate-treated rats 
      showed significantly higher serum concentrations of losartan after oral 
      administration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) 
      of losartan increased about 3-fold compared to control rats. The systemic 
      clearance of losartan significantly decreased from 410 +/- 254ml/h/kg in control 
      to 177 +/- 112ml/h/kg in uranyl nitrate-treated rats. In order to investigate the 
      mechanisms of reduced clearance of losartan associated with ARF, a hepatic 
      microsome fraction was prepared from normal and ARF rats. No significant 
      difference was found in the metabolism of losartan by hepatic microsomes prepared 
      from ARF and control rats. In addition, the metabolic activity of microsomes was 
      examined in the presence of uremic rat serum. The unbound clearance of losartan 
      and the unbound clearance associated with the formation of EXP3174 in the 
      presence of uremic serum were significantly lower than those in the presence of 
      control serum. Furthermore, the metabolism of losartan was inhibited by indoxyl 
      sulfate, a uremic toxin, in an uncompetitive manner. These results suggest that 
      ARF is associated with reduced clearance of losartan due to the inhibition of 
      hepatic metabolism by accumulated uremic toxin(s).

AB  - Losartan potassium is mainly metabolized by P450 chiefly in the liver. A P450 
      inducer, phenobarbital, has no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of 
      losartan. Cimetidine, known to inhibit P450 activity, has no remarkable effects 
      on the metabolism of losartan. Side effects of losartan has been very few in the 
      clinical trials of this drug on several thousands of patients so far. The rate 
      was as low as that of placebo. Losartan may cause hyperkalemia when used with 
      potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone or triamterene. Angioedema 
      and acute hepatitis had been reported in 3 patients among thousands of millions 
      of hypertensives under losartan treatment. The etiology was unclear, simple 
      coincidence may not be ruled out. Losartan should not be administered to pregnant 
      women and breast-feeding mothers, because it may disturb the fetal growth or may 
      be harmful to the newborn. It should be cautiously used in patients with renal 
      failure or liver disfunction.

TI  - ABCB1 c.2677G>T/c.3435C>T diplotype increases the early-phase oral absorption of 
      losartan.
PG  - 1187-1196
LID - 10.1007/s12272-020-01294-3 [doi]
AB  - Losartan has been shown to be a substrate of the drug-efflux transporter MDR1, 
      encoded by the ABCB1 gene. ABCB1 c.2677G>T and c.3435C>T variants are known to be 
      associated with reduced expression and function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We 
      investigated the effects of ABCB1 diplotype on the pharmacokinetics of losartan. 
      Thirty-eight healthy Korean volunteers with different ABCB1 diplotypes 
      [c.2677G> T and c.3435C>T; carriers of GG/CC (n = 13), GT/CT (n = 12) and TT/TT 
      (n = 13) diplotype] were recruited and administered a single 50 mg oral dose of 
      losartan potassium. Losartan and its active metabolite E-3174 samples in plasma 
      and urine were collected up to 10 and 8 h after drug administration, 
      respectively, and the concentrations of both samples were determined by HPLC 
      method. Significant differences were observed in C(max) of losartan and losartan 
      plus E-3174 (Lo + E) among the three diplotype groups (both P < 0.01). However, 
      the power of the performed test is less than the desired power (0.800). The 
      t(max) of losartan and E-3174 in three diplotype groups were also significantly 
      different (both P < 0.01). The AUC values of Lo + E were significantly different 
      among the three diplotype groups until 6 h after losartan administration 
      (P < 0.01). On the contrary, AUC at the periods of 8-10 h and 10 h-infinity of 
      Lo + E were significantly lower in the TT/TT group than in the GG/CC group. 
      Urinary excretion of losartan until 4 h after losartan administration in the 
      TT/TT group was higher than that of the GG/CC group. These results suggest that 
      c.2677G>T/c.3435C>T diplotypes of ABCB1 may significantly increase the 
      early-phase absorption of losartan, but not the total absorption.

AB  - Losartan potassium, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is the first of a new 
      class of agents to be introduced for the treatment of hypertension. In this 
      review, we describe the clinical pharmacology of losartan, including its 
      pharmacokinetics in healthy, male volunteers and special patient groups, such as 
      the elderly, patients with liver disease and patients with renal impairment. We 
      also review its pharmacodynamics, including safety and tolerability; specificity 
      of action; and the effect of salt depletion. We then review the studies examining 
      clinical efficacy and safety in hypertension.

TI  - Evaluation of the losartan solubility in the biowaiver context by shake-flask 
      method and intrinsic dissolution.
PG  - 283-292
LID - 10.1080/10837450.2018.1472610 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the shake-flask use as a universal method to 
      evaluate drug solubility in a biowaiver context as proposed by FDA, EMA and 
      ANVISA. The solubility of losartan was determined in three buffers using the 
      shake-flask method, intrinsic dissolution (ID) and Quantum Chemistry. Moreover, 
      the evaluation of a losartan dissolution profile from coated tablets was 
      conducted. The losartan low solubility in pH 1.2 and high solubility in pH 6.8 
      were observed using the shake-flask method. However, the solubility results using 
      ID demonstrated its high solubility in pH 1.2 and 6.8. It was not possible to 
      find conclusive results regarding the solubility of the drug in pH 4.5. The 
      studies conducted by Quantum Chemistry provide molecular and electronic data that 
      helped understand the losartan solvation in different pH values. Our experimental 
      results defined that losartan can be classified as a low-solubility drug. In 
      addition, this work shows that shake-flask cannot be a universal method of 
      solubility studies in biowaiver context. Individual analysis will be necessary. 
      The intrinsic dissolution should be considered as a complementary method.

TI  - Administration of vitamin E and losartan as prophylaxes in cisplatin-induced 
      nephrotoxicity model in rats.
PG  - 410-7
LID - 10.5301/jn.5000018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II; CDDP) is used widely as 
      an antitumor drug in clinics, but is accompanied with renal toxicity. The present 
      study was designed to compare the effect of losartan and vitamin E as prophylaxes 
      against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided 
      into 5 groups: group 1 receiving losartan 10 mg/kg; group 2, vitamin E in almond 
      oil 1 g/kg; group 3, combination of group 1 and 2 regimens; group 4, almond oil; 
      and group 5, negative control group. All groups were treated for a 4-day period, 
      but at day 3, groups 1-4 received a single dose (6 mg/kg) of CDDP. The animals 
      were sacrificed 1 week after CDDP administration. RESULTS: Animals' weight did 
      not change significantly, but increasing blood urea nitrogen and malondialdehyde 
      levels were observed statistically in all CDDP-treated animals. No detectable 
      change was observed in nitrite level, but serum osmolality in groups 1, 2 and 4 
      was different from that for group 5 (p<0.05). Kidney damage scoring showed no 
      significant difference between group 2 and the negative control group (group 2: 
      1.0 ± 0.24; group 5: 0.40 ± 0.10; p>0.05) but a statistically significant 
      difference from the positive control group (p<0.05). The tubular damage score of 
      group 1 also was not statistically significantly different from that of the 
      negative control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although vitamin E or losartan as 
      prophylaxes demonstrated some protective effects, the combination of losartan and 
      vitamin E did not protect against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity, for unknown 
      reasons which may relate to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions.

TI  - Amodiaquine, its desethylated metabolite, or both, inhibit the metabolism of 
      debrisoquine (CYP2D6) and losartan (CYP2C9) in vivo.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the extent of in vivo inhibition by the antimalarial drug 
      amodiaquine, its active metabolite N-desethylamodiaquine, or both, of the 
      metabolism of four probe drugs of the enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. 
      METHODS: Twelve healthy Swedish volunteers received a cocktail of four probe 
      drugs (debrisoquine, omeprazole, losartan and caffeine) to determine their 
      baseline metabolic capacities. After a washout period, they received a 600 mg 
      oral dose of amodiaquine hydrochloride; and 2-3 h later the cocktail was 
      administered again. One week after the intake of amodiaquine, the subjects 
      received the cocktail a third time. The levels of probe drugs and their 
      metabolites as well as amodiaquine and its metabolite were determined by HPLC. 
      RESULTS: Plasma levels of amodiaquine and N-desethylamodiaquine could be followed 
      in all subjects for 6 h and 28 days, respectively. Among the 12 subjects, a 
      3-fold variation in amodiaquine AUC and a 2-fold variation in 
      N-desethylamodiaquine AUC, were observed. The CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 activities of the 
      subjects were measured by debrisoquine and losartan phenotyping tests, 
      respectively. There were significant mean increases in debrisoquine metabolic 
      ratio (MR) between baseline and the second cocktail [MR(2 h)-MR(baseline) 1.426 
      (95% confidence interval 1.159, 1.755), P=0.002; ANOVA, Fisher LSD test] and in 
      mean losartan MR between baseline and the second cocktail [MR(2 h)-MR(baseline) 
      1.724 (95% confidence interval 1.076, 2.762), P=0.026; ANOVA, Fisher LSD test]. 
      The effects on CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 activities subsided within a week after intake 
      of amodiaquine as tested by the phenotyping cocktail. The changes in omeprazole 
      MRs and caffeine MRs were not statistically significant between any of the study 
      phases. CONCLUSION: A single dose of amodiaquine decreased CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 
      activities significantly compared to baseline values. Amodiaquine has the 
      potential to cause drug-drug interactions and should be further investigated in 
      malarial patients treated with drug combinations containing amodiaquine.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: the prototype losartan.
PG  - 625-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a new class of antihypertensive agents, the angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonists, with emphasis on the prototype losartan. Pharmacokinetic 
      data and clinical trials are reviewed, as well as adverse reactions, drug 
      interactions, and dosing guidelines. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of 
      English-language literature published from 1966 through 1995 was performed. In 
      addition, Merck and Co. provided bibliographic data on file for losartan. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Emphasis was placed on clinical and pharmacokinetic studies in humans. 
      Controlled, double-blind studies were evaluated to assess the efficacy and 
      adverse effect profile of losartan. DATA SYNTHESIS: Losartan is a nonpeptide, 
      competitive antagonist of the type I angiotensin II receptor. In comparative 
      clinical trials, losartan appears to have antihypertensive efficacy similar to 
      that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Losartan is well 
      tolerated, with an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo and a 
      reduced incidence of cough versus that with ACE inhibitors. A combination product 
      consisting of losartan 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg has also received 
      approval for the treatment of hypertension. The combination product is not 
      indicated for initial therapy, but is recommended for patients who do not respond 
      adequately to losartan monotherapy. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists are 
      also being investigated for beneficial effects in patients with ventricular 
      hypertrophy, renal disease, and heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Losartan, the first 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist to receive approval for use in the US, appears 
      to be an effective new antihypertensive agent with an adverse effect profile 
      similar to that of placebo. Losartan may be an alternative for patients who 
      cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. However, the effect of losartan on mortality 
      remains to be evaluated. The role of the angiotensin II receptor antagonists in 
      areas such as ventricular hypertrophy, renal function, and heart failure has yet 
      to be determined.

TI  - Conjugation to Ascorbic Acid Enhances Brain Availability of Losartan Carboxylic 
      Acid and Protects Against Parkinsonism in Rats.
PG  - 110
LID - 10.1208/s12248-018-0270-1 [doi]
AB  - Identification of renin-angiotensin system in the interplay of hypertension and 
      neurodegeneration has paved the way for the repurposing of antihypertensive drugs 
      against Parkinsonism. Losartan carboxylic acid (LCA), the potent AT1 blocker 
      metabolite of losartan, suffers from poor bioavailability and brain access. Since 
      ascorbate transporters have earlier shown enough flexibility as carriers, we have 
      conjugated losartan carboxylic acid to ascorbic acid with the aim of achieving 
      higher oral/brain availability. Ester of LCA and ascorbic acid (FED) was 
      developed keeping in view the substrate specificity of ascorbate transporters. 
      Oral/brain bioavailability was assessed using in vivo pharmacokinetic model. 
      Effect on central nervous system (CNS) and protection against Parkinsonism was 
      evaluated using in vivo models. FED enhanced bioavailability of LCA. The higher 
      brain availability of LCA enabled CNS protection as evident from the increase in 
      locomotor activity, improved motor coordination, and protection against 
      drug-induced catatonia. In conclusion, FED offers an approach to repurpose LCA 
      against Parkinsonism. This can encourage further investigation to simultaneously 
      address hypertension and neurodegeneration.

TI  - Chlorthalidone - a renaissance in use?
PG  - 2037-9
LID - 10.1517/14656560903158956 [doi]
AB  - Diuretic therapy remains a mainstay of hypertension treatment, either given as 
      monotherapy or used in combination with other antihypertensive compounds. Several 
      issues have complicated the issue of diuretic use with that of class effect being 
      the one that has proven most difficult. Hydrochlorothiazide is a commonly used 
      thiazide diuretic; whereas chlorthalidone is a structurally similar compound, 
      quite dissimilar pharmacokinetically with a much longer half-life for effect and 
      a wider volume of distribution with heavy partitioning in red blood cells. These 
      pharmacokinetic features afford chlorthalidone a unique advantage in its capacity 
      to act as an effective diuretic and blood-pressure-lowering agent, as well as a 
      compound that improves cardiovascular outcomes in the patient with hypertension. 
      Chlorthalidone has been used sparingly in clinical practice in large measure 
      because it is not readily available in many fixed-dose combination products. 
      Fixed-dose combinations containing chlorthalidone and an angiotensin-receptor 
      blocker are now in development. It remains to be determined how well these two 
      therapies will reduce blood pressure in the general population while keeping 
      compound-specific side effects to a minimum.

TI  - Ionotropic Cross-linked Carbo-protein Micro Matrix System: An Approach for 
      Improvement of Drug Release, Compaction and Tableting behavior of Losartan 
      Potassium.
PG  - 533-43
AB  - The aim of the present research work is to develop carbo-protein polymeric 
      complex based sustain release microspheres of losartan potassium and investigate 
      the ability of this dosage form to improve the flowability, compressibility and 
      tableting properties of losartan potassium. The influence of silk sericin, 
      alginate and its blend on various physicochemical parameters and in vitro drug 
      release pattern were studied to optimize the concentration of polymeric blend 
      required for 12 h. sustain release. Optimized batch was subjected to different 
      flowability, compressibility and tableting properties studies to observe the 
      effects of carbo-protein microspheres on flow properties. Results indicated that 
      the concentration of sericin was found to be the main influential factor for 
      prolonged drug release. Different micromeritic studies revealed that the poor 
      flowability and compressibility properties of pure losartan potassium were 
      significantly improved by this algino-sericin microspheric dosage form. Research 
      findings also revealed that plasticity, die filling behavior and tableting 
      properties of the pure drug were significantly improved by this microsphere 
      formulation. So these prospective results concluded that carbo-protein polymeric 
      microspheres helps to sustain the drug release for prolong hours as well as 
      improve the flowability, compressibility and tableting properties of losartan 
      potassium.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
PG  - 1-29
AB  - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of nonpeptide angiotensin 
      antagonists in humans are reviewed in this paper. Representatives of this new 
      therapeutic class share common features: lipophilia, intermediate 
      bioavailability, high affinity for plasma proteins and liver metabolism; some 
      have active metabolites. Angiotensin II antagonists block the blood pressure 
      response to exogenous angiotensin II in healthy volunteers, decrease baseline 
      blood pressure in both normal and hypertensive patients, produce a marked rise in 
      plasma renin activity and endogenous angiotensin II and increase renal blood flow 
      without altering glomerular filtration rate. These effects are dose-dependent, 
      but their time course varies between the drugs owing to pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic differences. Additionally, the extent of blood pressure reduction 
      is dependent on physiological factors such as sodium and water balance. The 
      characterisation of their pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships deserves 
      further refinement for designing optimal therapeutic regimens and proposing 
      dosage adaptations in specific conditions.

TI  - Biotransformation of losartan to its active carboxylic acid metabolite in human 
      liver microsomes. Role of cytochrome P4502C and 3A subfamily members.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - Losartan is a 4-chloro-5-hydroxymethylimidazole derivative that is a potent and 
      highly selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Losartan is metabolized in 
      vivo in rats, monkeys, and humans to a carboxylic acid derivative E3174 that is 
      pharmacologically more active than the parent compound. We have investigated the 
      mechanism of this biotransformation in human liver preparations. The oxidation of 
      both losartan and the putative aldehyde intermediate E3179 was catalyzed by the 
      microsomal fraction, required both NADPH and molecular oxygen, and was inhibited 
      by SKF 525-A, implicating cytochrome P450 (CYP). When incubations with each 
      substrate were performed under an atmosphere of 18O2, the extent of 18O 
      incorporation into the carboxylic acid product was consistent with a mechanism 
      for losartan oxidation involving an aldehyde intermediate. To substantiate the 
      involvement of CYP in these reactions, incubations with losartan and the aldehyde 
      E3179 were performed in the presence of isoform-selective inhibitors. Inhibitors 
      of CYP3A4/5 (gestodene and ketoconazole) and CYP2C9/10 (sulfaphenazole) 
      attenuated the oxidation of both substrates. It was then demonstrated that 
      microsomes containing either recombinant human liver CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 were 
      capable of oxidizing both losartan and the aldehyde E3179 to the carboxylic acid 
      E3174. Subsequently, it was shown that rabbit anti-CYP2C9 and anti-CYP3A3/4 
      inhibited the oxidation of losartan to E3174 in incubations with human liver 
      microsomes. These studies support the hypothesis that the aldehyde E3179 is an 
      intermediate in the oxidation of losartan and that this two-step reaction is 
      catalyzed in human liver microsomes by members of the CYP3A and CYP2C 
      subfamilies.

TI  - Effect of losartan potassium, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on renal 
      excretion of oxypurinol and purine bases.
PG  - 2232-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether losartan affects the plasma concentrations and 
      urinary excretion of purine bases and oxypurinol. METHODS: We administered 
      allopurinol (300 mg) and then 9 h later losartan potassium (100 mg) to 5 healthy 
      subjects. RESULTS: The urinary excretion of uric acid increased by 3.9- and 
      2.6-fold, and that of oxypurinol by 2- and 1.8-fold, at 1 to 2 h and at 2 to 3 h, 
      respectively, after administration of losartan potassium. The fractional 
      clearance of uric acid was increased by 4.3- and 3.2-fold, oxypurinol by 2.3- and 
      2.1-fold, and xanthine by 1.32- and 1.26-fold, at 1 to 2 h and at 2 to 3 h, 
      respectively, after administration of losartan potassium. The plasma 
      concentrations of uric acid decreased by 8% and 16%, oxypurinol by 7% and 11%, 
      and xanthine by 42% and 45%, at 1.5 and 2.5 h, respectively, after oral 
      administration. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that losartan potassium could 
      increase urinary excretion of uric acid, xanthine, and oxypurinol by acting on 
      their common renal transport pathways, since it was found that uric acid may 
      share a renal transport pathway with oxypurinol and xanthine. It is also 
      suggested that the effect of losartan potassium on oxypurinol and uric acid is 
      clinically important, since the hypouricemic effect of a combination therapy 
      using allopurinol and losartan potassium may be less than additive, while the 
      uricosuric effect of losartan potassium may increase the frequency of calculi in 
      the urinary tract.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of angiotensin II (AT1) receptor blockers in 
      hypertension.
PG  - S73-86
AB  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) represent a new class of effective and 
      well tolerated orally active antihypertensive agents. Recent clinical trials have 
      shown the added benefits of ARBs in hypertensive patients (reduction in left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic function, decrease in 
      ventricular arrhythmias, reduction in microalbuminuria, and improvement in renal 
      function), and cardioprotective effect in patients with heart failure. Several 
      large long-term studies are in progress to assess the beneficial effects of ARBs 
      on cardiac hypertrophy, renal function, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
      morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with or without diabetes 
      mellitus, and the value of these drugs in patients with heart disease and 
      diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs specifically block the interaction of angiotensin 
      II at the AT1 receptor, thereby relaxing smooth muscle, increasing salt and water 
      excretion, reducing plasma volume, and decreasing cellular hypertrophy. These 
      agents exert their blood pressure-lowering effect mainly by reducing peripheral 
      vascular resistance usually without a rise in heart rate. Most of the 
      commercially available ARBs control blood pressure for 24 h after once daily 
      dosing. Sustained efficacy of blood pressure control, without any evidence of 
      tachyphylaxis, has been demonstrated after long-term administration (3 years) of 
      some of the ARBs. The efficacy of ARBs is similar to that of thiazide diuretics, 
      beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel 
      blockers in patients with similar degree of hypertension. Higher daily doses, 
      dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACE inhibitor 
      administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of ARBs. The ARBs have a low 
      incidence of adverse effects (headache, upper respiratory infection, back pain, 
      muscle cramps, fatigue and dizziness), even in the elderly patients. After the 
      approval of losartan, five other ARBs (candesartan cilexetil, eprosartan, 
      irbesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan) and three combinations with 
      hydrochlorothiazide (irbesartan, losartan and valsartan) have been approved as 
      antihypertensive agents, and some 28 compounds are in various stages of 
      development. The ARBs are non-peptide compounds with varied structures; some 
      (candesartan, losartan, irbesartan, and valsartan) have a common 
      tetrazolo-biphenyl structure. Except for irbesartan, all active ARBs have a 
      carboxylic acid group. Candesartan cilexetil is a prodrug, while losartan has a 
      metabolite (EXP3174) which is more active than the parent drug. No other 
      metabolites of ARBs contribute significantly to the antihypertensive effect. The 
      variation in the molecular structure of the ARBs results in differences in the 
      binding affinity to the receptor and pharmacokinetic profiles. The differences 
      observed in lipid solubility, absorption/distribution, plasma protein binding, 
      bioavailability, biotransformation, plasma half-life, and systemic elimination 
      influence the time of onset, duration of action, and efficacy of the ARBs. On the 
      basis of the daily mg dose, the antihypertensive potency of the ARBs follows the 
      sequence: candesartan cilexetil > telmisartan approximately = losartan > 
      irbesartan approximately = valsartan > eprosartan. After oral administration, the 
      ARBs are rapidly absorbed (time for peak plasma levels = 0.5-4 h) but they have a 
      wide range of bioavailability (from a low of 13% for eprosartan to a high of 
      60-80% for irbesartan); food does not influence the bioavailability, except for 
      valsartan (a reduction of 40-50%) and eprosartan (increase). A limited dose-peak 
      plasma levels/areas under the plasma level-time curve proportionality is observed 
      for some of the ARBs. Most of these drugs have high plasma protein binding 
      (95-100%); irbesartan has the lowest binding among the group (90%). The 
      steady-state volumes of distribution vary from a low of 9 L (candesartan) to a 
      high of 500 L (telmisartan). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATE

TI  - Simultaneous determination of losartan, EXP-3174 and hydrochlorothiazide in 
      plasma via fully automated 96-well-format-based solid-phase extraction and liquid 
      chromatography-negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 593-601
AB  - An automated, sensitive and high-throughput liquid chromatographic/electrospray 
      tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed for the simultaneous 
      determination of losartan (LOS), its major circulating metabolite EXP-3174 and 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in human plasma. LOS and HCTZ coexist in the same drug 
      formulation, and this is the first method that enables the simultaneous 
      determination of both drugs along with the active metabolite of LOS. Since these 
      drugs have different physicochemical properties, the employment of a 
      liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) protocol was precluded. A fully automated 
      solid-phase extraction (SPE) protocol, based on 96-well format plates, was used 
      to isolate these compounds and furosemide (internal standard, IS) from plasma. 
      Washing and elution steps were amended accordingly in order to minimize any 
      matrix effect from components of the plasma without reducing the elution of the 
      molecules of interest. The compounds were eluted from a C18 column and detected 
      with an API 3000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer using negative electrospray 
      ionization and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The assay was linear over the 
      range 1.00-400 ng/mL for LOS and EXP-3174 and 0.500-200 ng/mL for HCTZ, 
      respectively, when 200 microl of plasma was used in the extraction. The overall 
      intra- and interassay variations were within acceptance limits. The analysis time 
      for each sample was 4 min, and more than 300 samples could be analyzed in one day 
      by running the system overnight. The assay was simple, highly sensitive, 
      selective, precise, fast, and it enables the reliable determination of LOS, 
      EXP-3174 and HCTZ in pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence studies after per os 
      administration of a single tablet containing both drugs.

PG  - 41865

AB  - Excessive myocardial collagen deposition and cross-linking (CCL), a process 
      regulated by lysyl oxidase (LOX), determines left ventricular (LV) stiffness and 
      dysfunction. The angiotensin II antagonist losartan, metabolized to the EXP3179 
      and EXP3174 metabolites, reduces myocardial fibrosis and LV stiffness in 
      hypertensive patients. Our aim was to investigate the differential influence of 
      losartan metabolites on myocardial LOX and CCL in an experimental model of 
      hypertension with myocardial fibrosis, and whether EXP3179 and EXP3174 modify LOX 
      expression and activity in fibroblasts. In rats treated with 
      N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), administration of EXP3179 fully 
      prevented LOX, CCL and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) increase, as well 
      as fibrosis, without normalization of blood pressure (BP). In contrast, 
      administration of EXP3174 normalized BP and attenuated fibrosis but did not 
      modify LOX, CCL and CTGF. In TGF-β(1)-stimulated fibroblasts, EXP3179 inhibited 
      CTGF and LOX expression and activity with lower IC50 values than EXP3174. Our 
      results indicate that, despite a lower antihypertensive effect, EXP3179 shows 
      higher anti-fibrotic efficacy than EXP3174, likely through its ability to prevent 
      the excess of LOX and CCL. It is suggested that the anti-fibrotic effect of 
      EXP3179 may be partially mediated by the blockade of CTGF-induced LOX in 
      fibroblasts.

TI  - Renal effects of losartan and amlodipine in hypertensive patients with 
      non-diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 3096-102
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of angiotensin 
      II receptor blocker losartan versus the calcium channel blocker amlodipine on 
      proteinuria, renal haemodynamics, glomerular sieving and tubular function in 
      hypertensive patients with non-diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: The study design 
      was a prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized crossover trial 
      with amlodipine and losartan. Renal parameters were measured at baseline and at 
      the end of each 4-week active treatment period. Fifteen patients with a diagnosis 
      of non-diabetic renal disease and hypertension were included. RESULTS: Mean 
      arterial blood pressure decreased from 123+/-13 mmHg at baseline to 113+/-10 mmHg 
      (P<0.01) on losartan and to 114+/-10 mmHg on amlodipine (P<0.01). Urinary albumin 
      excretion significantly decreased from 3510+/-2586 mg/24 h at baseline to 
      2684+/-2051 mg/24 h (P<0.01) on losartan and increased non-significantly to 
      3748+/-3355 mg/24 h on amlodipine. Filtration fraction significantly decreased 
      from a baseline value of 22.8+/-9.3% to 21.2+/-10.2% (P<0.05) on losartan and 
      increased to 23.6+/-8.9% (ns) on amlodipine. Either drug did not significantly 
      alter glomerular sieving of neutral dextrans. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate 
      that losartan, but not amlodipine, decreased albumin excretion in hypertensive 
      patients with non-diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic assessment of the hypotensive effect after

PG  - 207-15
AB  - The interactive hypotensive effect of the combination treatment of losartan (LOS) 
      and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was assessed using a 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 
      Intravenous coadministration of these drugs showed a prolonged and enhanced 
      time-course of the hypotensive effect. A population PK analysis revealed the 
      delayed elimination of LOS after coadministration. The time-course of the plasma 
      renin activity (PRA) was measured, and showed a more continuative time profile 
      after coadministration compared with the administration of LOS alone. An indirect 
      response model was applied to describe the relationship between the PK of LOS and 
      the PRA profile, and the E(max) value for the increase of the PRA by LOS was 
      increased with the dose of HCTZ. Blood pressure was linked to the PRA through an 
      effect compartment. The model successfully described the relationship between the 
      doses of LOS and HCTZ and their interactive hypotensive effect. These results 
      indicate that the interaction for blood pressure in the combination treatment of 
      LOS and HCTZ can be estimated using the doses of the drugs and the PRA-mediated 
      PK-PD model.

AB  - We screened for the presence of 66 different pharmaceutical residues in surface 
      waters and in multiple invertebrate and fish species of the Tejo estuary to 
      produce an environmental risk assessment of individual pharmaceuticals and their 
      mixtures, as well as evaluate the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in one of 
      Europe's largest estuarine systems. Sixteen pharmaceutical residues, from seven 
      therapeutic classes, were detected in estuarine waters, with environmental 
      mixture concentrations ranging from 42 to 1762 ng/L. Environmental risk 
      assessment via the determination of risk quotients, demonstrated high ecological 
      risk for the antibiotic amoxicillin and angiotensin II receptor blockers 
      irbesartan and losartan. Moderate risk was estimated for antidepressants, 
      antiepileptics, anxiolytics and beta-blockers, but the risk quotient of the 
      accumulated mixture of compounds was over 380-fold higher than the no risk 
      threshold, driven by antibiotics and angiotensin II receptor blockers. In biota, 
      higher risk therapeutic groups were found in higher concentrations, with nine 
      pharmaceutical residues detected, including six antibiotics and two neuroactive 
      compounds, and maximum tissue concentrations up to 250 μg/kg. Bioaccumulation was 
      species- and compound-specific, with only two compounds found simultaneously in 
      water and biota, likely a result of the complex dynamics and fate of 
      pharmaceuticals in estuarine waters. Nonetheless, higher detection frequencies 
      were observed in species living directly on or just above the substrate (i.e. 
      benthic and demersal species), underpinning the importance of habitat use, as 
      well the potential role of sediment and diet based routes for pharmaceutical 
      uptake. Ultimately, results support urgent action on managing the impact of 
      pharmaceuticals in coastal environments, striving for improved monitoring schemes 
      tailored to the dynamic nature and ecological diversity of estuaries and coastal 
      ecosystems.

TI  - Clinical pharmacology of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan 
      potassium in healthy subjects.
PG  - S23-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The evaluation of a new drug in normotensive volunteers provides 
      important pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information as long as the compound 
      has a specific mechanism of action which can be evaluated in healthy subjects as 
      well as in patients. The purpose of the present paper is to discuss the results 
      that have been obtained in normal volunteers with the specific angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonist, losartan potassium. DOSE-FINDING: Over the last few years, 
      studies in normotensive subjects have demonstrated that the minimal dose of 
      losartan that produces maximal efficacy is 40-80 mg. Losartan has a long duration 
      of action and its ability to produce a sustained blockade of the 
      renin-angiotensin system is due almost exclusively to the active metabolite 
      E3174. HORMONAL EFFECTS: Angiotensin II receptor blockade with losartan induces 
      an expected increase in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels. A 
      decrease in plasma aldosterone levels has been found only with a high dose of 
      losartan (120 mg). RENAL AND BLOOD PRESSURE EFFECTS: In normotensive subjects, 
      losartan has little or no effect on blood pressure unless the subjects are 
      markedly salt-depleted. Losartan causes no change in the glomerular filtration 
      rate and either no modification or only a slight increase in renal blood flow. 
      Losartan significantly increases urinary sodium excretion, however, and 
      surprisingly produces a transient rise in urinary potassium excretion. Finally, 
      losartan increases uric acid excretion and lowers plasma uric acid levels. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that losartan is an effective angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonist in normal subjects. Its safety and clinical efficacy in 
      hypertensive patients will be addressed in large clinical trials.

TI  - Drug Interactions with Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: Role of Human Cytochromes 
      P450.
PG  - 681-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the most recent class of 
      agents for the treatment of hypertension. However, ARBs may cause a low incidence 
      of headache, upper respiratory infection, back pain, muscle cramps, fatigue, 
      dizziness, and many other side effects. In some cases, such toxicity is 
      associated with pharmacokinetic alterations. METHODS: The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      enzyme system plays an important role in a lot of clinically important 
      pharmacokinetic drug interactions. To identify relevant studies on drug-drug and 
      food-drug pharmacokinetic interactions with the ARBs, a literature search of 
      Google Scholar was performed from January 1994 to June 2015, with the following 
      keywords: 'losartan', 'valsartan,' 'candesartan,' 'irbesartan,' 'telmisartan,' 
      'eprosartan,' 'olmesartan,' and 'azilsartan', combined with the keyword 
      'pharmacokinetic interactions' and 'CYP'. RESULTS: Based on the literatures 
      published, it has been demonstrated that pharmacokinetic interactions of losartan 
      with other agents are mainly via CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-mediated, the role played by 
      CYP enzyme system in the metabolism of valsartan, candesartan, irbesartan, and 
      azilsartan appears modest, and cytochrome P450 system has no influence on the 
      metabolism of telmisartan, eprosartan, olmesartan. Therefore, according to these 
      pharmacokinetic findings, no dosage adjustment is recommended when eprosartan, 
      telmisartan and olmesartan are combined with other pharmacological agents in 
      patients with hypertension. CONCLUSION: This review summarize the available data 
      on cytochrome P450 - related drug-drug interactions reported in the literature 
      for the eight ARBs. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the ARBs 
      should allow the avoidance of the majority of drug interactions without 
      compromising therapeutic benefits.

LID - 10.1177/0091270010370846 [doi]
AB  - Drug interactions are a significant clinical concern, particularly in patients 
      with conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, in whom coadministration 
      of multiple drugs is common. Nebivolol is a selective β(1)-blocker with 
      vasodilatory properties approved for the treatment of hypertension. Drug-drug 
      interactions were investigated when nebivolol was coadministered to subjects 
      classified as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers who were 
      receiving other drugs commonly administered to patients with hypertension or 
      compounds metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. There were no drug-drug 
      interactions when nebivolol was coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide, 
      furosemide, ramipril, losartan, digoxin, or warfarin. Coadministration with 
      fluoxetine (also metabolized by CYP2D6) in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers impeded 
      the apparent clearance of nebivolol. The authors conclude that nebivolol is safe 
      and well tolerated regardless of genotype and type of medication coadministered.

TI  - Effect of losartan on serum uric acid in hypertension treated with a diuretic: 
      the COMFORT study.
PG  - 192-6
LID - 10.3109/10641963.2014.933968 [doi]
AB  - It has been shown that losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), 
      reduces serum uric acid levels. However, the effects of losartan on serum uric 
      acid levels in the patients treated with a thiazide diuretic have not been fully 
      elucidated. We have investigated the effects of losartan compared with other ARBs 
      on blood variables and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients treated 
      with a thiazide diuretic using data from the COMFORT study. The present analysis 
      included a total of 118 hypertensive subjects on combination treatment with ARBs 
      except for losartan and a diuretic who were randomly assigned to a daily regimen 
      of a combination pill (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or to 
      continuation of two pills, an ARB except for losartan and a diuretic. Blood 
      pressures were evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months after randomization and changes in 
      blood variables including serum uric acid were evaluated during 6 months 
      treatment period. Mean follow-up blood pressure levels were not different between 
      the combination pill (losartan treatment) group and the control (ARBs except for 
      losartan) group. On the other hand, serum uric acid significantly decreased in 
      the combination pill group compared with the control group (-0.44 versus + 0.10 
      mg/dl; p = 0.01), although hematocrit, serum creatinine, sodium and potassium 
      were not different between the groups. These results suggest that the treatment 
      regimen switched from a combination therapy of ARBs except for losartan and a 
      diuretic to a combination pill (losartan/ hydrochlorothiazide) decreases serum 
      uric acid without affecting blood pressure control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to design an efficient delivery 
      system with an anticipated swelling and drug release properties for a prolonged 
      drug release as well as to target colon for various hydrophilic drugs. METHOD: 
      For this purpose, the pH-responsive hydrogel comprising a combination of Eudragit 
      and acrylic acid was formed. The hydrogels were characterized for spectral 
      (FTIR), thermal (TGA/DSC), structural (XRD), and morphological (SEM) 
      investigations. Oral tolerability was assessed in rabbits for biocompatibility 
      and oral use of the prepared hydrogels. RESULTS: The results showed that an 
      increased incorporation of Eudragit and cross-linking agent retorted the 
      swelling, drug loading, and drug release properties at both acid (pH 1.2) and 
      basic pH (pH 6.8 and 7.4) , while acrylic acid presented the inverse results. The 
      oral tolerability and toxicity studies depicted that the developed hydrogels were 
      safe up to 3800 mg/kg body weight and caused no hematological or 
      histopathological changes when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: 
      Therefore, the newly developed formulations presented adequate swelling, drug 
      loading, release behavior, and biocompatibility properties and thus can be used 
      as a promising tool for the colonic delivery of various hydrophilic drugs.

AB  - Recent experimental data suggest that certain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
      inhibitors and angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists may possess anticonvulsant 
      activity. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two ACE 
      inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and two AT1 receptor antagonists, losartan 
      and telmisartan, on the protective action of gabapentin in the maximal 
      electroshock seizure threshold test in mice. Additionally, the effects of the 
      combined treatment with gabapentin and antihypertensive drugs on memory retention 
      in the passive avoidance task and motor coordination in the chimney test were 
      assessed. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally. Losartan (50mg/kg) 
      significantly increased the convulsive threshold for gabapentin. The other 
      antihypertensive drugs, captopril (50mg/kg), enalapril (30 mg/kg) and telmisartan 
      (30 mg/kg), did not affect the anticonvulsant activity of gabapentin. The 
      observed interaction between gabapentin and losartan could be pharmacokinetic in 
      nature. Losartan increased plasma and total brain concentrations of gabapentin. 
      In the chimney test, losartan (50mg/kg) administered with gabapentin (50mg/kg) 
      caused motor impairment. In the passive avoidance test, memory retention was not 
      affected by the combined treatment with gabapentin and antihypertensive drugs. It 
      is suggested that the use of captopril, enalapril and telmisartan in epileptic 
      patients receiving gabapentin is presumed neutral upon its anticonvulsant action. 
      The utmost caution is advised when combining losartan and gabapentin in clinical 
      practice due to the appearance of pharmacokinetic interactions between losartan 
      and gabapentin as well as motor impairment evoked by these drugs in mice.

TI  - Simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for determination of 
      losartan and E-3174 metabolite in human plasma, urine and dialysate.
PG  - 374-8
AB  - A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for 
      the determination of losartan and its E-3174 metabolite in human plasma, urine 
      and dialysate. For plasma, a gradient mobile phase consisting of 25 mM potassium 
      phosphate and acetonitrile pH 2.2 was used with a phenyl analytical column and 
      fluorescence detection. For urine and dialysate, an isocratic mobile phase 
      consisting of 25 mM potassium phosphate and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) pH 2.2 was 
      used. The method demonstrated linearity from 10 to 1000 ng/ml with a detection 
      limit of 1 ng/ml for losartan and E-3174 using 10 microl of prepared plasma, 
      urine or dialysate. The method was utilized in a study evaluating the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of losartan in patients with kidney 
      failure undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).

TI  - Recent trends in preclinical drug-drug interaction studies of flavonoids--Review 
      of case studies, issues and perspectives.
PG  - 1679-91
LID - 10.1002/ptr.5447 [doi]
AB  - Because of health benefits that are manifested across various disease areas, the 
      consumption of herbal products and/or health supplements containing different 
      kinds of flavonoids has been on the rise. While the drug-drug interaction 
      potential between flavonoids and co-ingested drugs still remain an issue, 
      opportunities exist for the combination of flavonoids with suitable anti-cancer 
      drugs to enhance the bioavailability of anti-cancer drugs and thereby reduce the 
      dose size of the anti-cancer drugs and improve its therapeutic index. In recent 
      years, scores of flavonoids have undergone preclinical investigation with variety 
      of drugs encompassing therapeutic areas such as oncology (etoposide, doxorubicin, 
      paclitaxel, tamoxifen etc.), immunosuppression (cyclosporine) and hypertension 
      (losartan, felodipine, nitrendipine etc.). The review provides examples of the 
      recent trends in the preclinical investigation of 14 flavonoids (morin, 
      quercetin, silibinin, kaempferol etc.) with various co-administered drugs. The 
      relevance of combination of flavonoids with anti-cancer drugs and a framework to 
      help design the in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies to gain better 
      mechanistic insights are discussed. Also, concise discussions on the various 
      physiological factors that contribute for the reduced bioavailability of 
      flavonoids along with the significant challenges in the data interpretation are 
      provided.

AB  - Fimasartan is the ninth and latest Angiotensin Receptor Blockers for the 
      treatment of hypertension. Fimasartan is a derivative of losartan in which the 
      imidazole ring has been replaced. It provides a selective type 1 angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonist effect with noncompetitive, in surmountable binding. 
      Fimasartan is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with an oral 
      bioavailability of 18.6 ± 7.2%. Fimasartan is relatively stable in terms of 
      metabolism and more than 90% of circulating fimasartan moieties in the plasma are 
      in the parent form; fecal elimination and biliary excretion are the predominant 
      elimination pathways of fimasartan. Areas covered: We reviewed data from clinical 
      trials that investigated safety and efficacy of fimasartan in hypertension. 
      Expert opinion: Fimasartan proved good efficacy in blood pressure reduction. In 
      large clinical studies,fimasartan showed an excellent safety profile and when 
      combined with hydrochlorothiazide oram lodipine, it showed a better effect on 
      controlling blood pressure than monotherapy. Fimasartan 60-120 mg once daily has 
      also shown an antihypertensive effect over 24-h. Moreover, preclinical studies 
      demonstrated organ-protecting effects of fimasartan. These results make 
      fimasartan an attractive candidate for the treatment of hypertension. However, it 
      remains to test the benefit of using fimasartan on clinical outcomes.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor polymorphisms in hypertension. Pharmacogenomic 
      considerations.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - Molecular variants of individual components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 
      are thought to contribute to inherited predisposition towards essential 
      hypertension. Polymorphisms in genes of angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin 
      I-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1) have been 
      related to differential responses to antihypertensive drugs. AT-1 receptor 
      mediates the major pressor and trophic actions of angiotensin II (Ang II). At 
      least 14 AT-1 polymorphisms have been described in the gene (AGT1R); in 
      particular the +1166 A/C polymorphism has been associated with the severe form of 
      essential hypertension. A relationship was suggested between this polymorphism 
      and the humoral and renal hemodynamic responses to losartan, an antihypertensive 
      drug acting as an AT-1 blocker. Variability in the individual response to AT-1 
      antagonists could also be due to variations in the pharmacokinetics of the drugs. 
      This review presents current knowledge on Ang II-receptors and polymorphisms in 
      AGT1R related to cardiovascular disease and antihypertensive therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin II receptor blockers are widely used for the treatment 
      of arterial hypertension and heart failure. However, recent studies on animal 
      models of seizures showed that in the brain, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
      system might be involved in neuroinflammation; therefore, the administration of 
      angiotensin II receptor blockers that cross the blood/brain barrier, reduces not 
      only blood pressure but reduces neuroinflammation-induced neuronal injury. Apart 
      from this neuroprotective effect, these drugs exhibit anticonvulsant activity in 
      animal models of seizures, and losartan is associated with a probable 
      anti-epileptogenic activity. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we intended to 
      highlight the role of drug-drug interactions involving angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists with antiepileptic drugs accompanied by a brief characteristic of the 
      role of RAS in neuroinflammation. EXPERT OPINION: Some combinations of 
      antiepileptic drugs (lamotrigine or valproate) with sartans are particularly 
      effective in terms of enhanced seizure control. Considering a possible 
      anti-epileptogenic activity of losartan, its combinations with antiepileptic 
      drugs may prove especially beneficial in epileptogenesis inhibition.

TI  - Pharmacology of angiotensin II receptors in the kidney.
PG  - 1486-91
AB  - Within the kidney angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts potent effects on renal 
      function. The intrarenal actions of Ang II include modulation of renal blood 
      flow, glomerular filtration rate, tubular epithelial transport, renin release and 
      cellular growth. The actions of Ang II on the kidney are mediated by specific 
      intrarenal receptors which, based upon physical characteristics and the selective 
      binding of non-peptide and peptide analogs may be divided into two main subtypes, 
      termed AT1 and AT2. AT1 receptors are present within the kidneys of all species 
      and are located predominantly in the glomerulus, the renal tubules and the renal 
      vasculature, including the afferent and efferent arterioles. Modulation of AT1 
      receptors within the kidney has been shown to mediate essentially all of the 
      known intrarenal effects of Ang II. AT1 receptors and particularly AT2 receptors 
      are expressed in large numbers in fetal kidney where they may play a role in 
      development and maturation. In some species, intrarenal AT2 receptors disappear 
      shortly after birth. In those species where AT2 receptors are present in the 
      adult kidney their role in the control of renal function has not yet been clearly 
      defined.

TI  - Bioequivalence study of two losartan tablet formulations with special emphasis on 
      cardiac safety.
PG  - 349-59
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the bioequivalence of Losartan Potassium Tablets 50 mg 
      manufactured by Micro Labs Ltd. India to Cozaar® Tablets 50 mg, manufactured by 
      Merck Sharp and Dohme Ltd., UK in normal healthy adult subjects under fasting 
      condition along with the comparative safety evaluation of both treatments. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro dissolution studies were carried out on 12 
      units each of test and reference products using the paddle method and dissolution 
      media like water, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid with pH 1.2, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and 
      pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. An open label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, 
      two-sequence, crossover bioequivalence study with a washout period of 7 days was 
      conducted in 60 healthy Indian male subjects. Serial blood samples were collected 
      after drug administration in each study period. Plasma concentrations of losartan 
      and losartan acid were determined using a validated LC-MS-MS method. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan and losartan acid were determined using a 
      non compartmental model. Occurrence of adverse events, change in systolic blood 
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and QT interval from the baseline 
      to 3.50 h post dose were studied and compared between the two treatments as 
      safety parameters. RESULTS: The in vitro study proved the essential similarity of 
      both the formulations as evident from the similarity factor of > 50% in all the 
      dissolution media. The ratios for geometric least square means and 90% confidence 
      intervals were within the acceptance criteria of 80% to 125% for log transformed 
      C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) for losartan. No statistically significant 
      difference between the two treatments was observed for either of the safety 
      parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The test product Losartan Potassium tablets 50 mg 
      manufactured by Micro Labs Limited, India was bioequivalent to Cozaar® tablets 50 
      mg, manufactured by Merck Sharp and Dohme Ltd., UK in terms of rate and extent of 
      absorption. Both treatments were well tolerated and had similar non significant 
      effect on the safety parameters.

AB  - A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      method employing electronspray ionization was developed and validated for 
      quantification of losartan and its carboxylic acid metabolite in human plasma 
      using irbesartan as internal standard (IS). Following a simple pretreatment 
      procedure, the analytes were separated using a gradient mobile phase on reverse 
      phase C18 column. Selected reaction monitoring was specific for losartan, 
      losartan acid and irbesartan. The method validation demonstrated the specificity, 
      lower limit of quantification, accuracy and precision of measurements. The assay 
      exhibited a linear dynamic range of 2.0-400 ng/mL for losartan and 1.85-370 ng/mL 
      for losartan acid. A run time of 3.5 min for each sample made it possible to 
      analyze more than 200 samples per day. The validated method has been successfully 
      used to analyze human plasma samples for application in 
      bioavailability/bioequivalence studies.

TI  - Valsartan for the treatment of heart failure.
PG  - 181-93
AB  - Heart failure (HF) still has a discouraging prognosis. Therapeutic strategies aim 
      to reduce mortality as well as slow the progression of the disease, improve 
      symptoms and reduce the frequency of hospital admission. Activation of the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hallmark of several 
      cardiocirculatory diseases, including HF. Drugs for evidence-based therapy of HF 
      are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers and 
      aldosterone antagonists. A promising alternative is a more complete action on the 
      RAAS through selective blockade of the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, 
      taking into account not only physiopathological issues but also pharmacological, 
      experimental and clinical data. The effect of valsartan, an orally-active, 
      selective antagonist of AT(1) receptors, on the outcome in patients with chronic 
      and symptomatic HF was evaluated in a large-scale, international, 
      placebo-controlled clinical study, the Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial 
      (Val-HeFT). In this study, overall mortality was similar in the valsartan and 
      placebo groups (19.7 and 19.4%, respectively). However, valsartan, in addition to 
      recommended therapy of HF including an ACEI, significantly reduced the combined 
      end point of mortality and morbidity, with a significant reduction in the risk of 
      hospitalisation, paralleled by improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
      functional class, signs and symptoms and quality of life. Valsartan also improved 
      left ventricular anatomy and function and significantly reduced neurohormonal 
      activation. These results were confirmed and extended by the CHARM trial, where 
      the benefits of candesartan were proved not only in all 7599 patients with HF, 
      but also in the 2548 given an ACEI, the 2028 not given an ACEI and in the 3023 
      patients with an ejection fraction of > 40%. In conclusion, the first choice for 
      HF remains an ACEI with a beta-blocker, but two new options are emerging. In 
      patients intolerant to ACEI, the combination of valsartan or candesartan with a 
      beta-blocker is proposed, whereas an ACEI with either valsartan or candesartan 
      can be considered in patients intolerant to or with contraindications to 
      beta-blockers.

PG  - 17-22
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a HPLC assay for plasma losartan and its active metabolite 
      EXP3174 to facilitate clinical pharmacokinetic studies. METHODS: the HPLC system 
      consisted of a 250 x 2 mm i.d. C18 reversed phase column preceded by a 4 x 4 mm 
      guard column, a UV detector set at 254 nm, and an integrator. The mobile phase 
      was a mixture of 0.01 M ammonium phosphate: acetonitrile: methanol (6:3:1) 
      containing 0.02 % sodium azide and 0.04% TEA, with pH adjusted to 3.2. The system 
      was operated isocratically at ambient temperature at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. 
      Losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 were extracted from plasma using C2 
      bonded silica gel standard solid phase extraction. RESULTS: recoveries of 
      losartan and EXP3174 from plasma were greater than 70%. Using 0.5 ml of plasma 
      sample, standard curves were linear from 10 to 300 ng/ml (r2 = 0.996 and 0.997 
      for losartan and EXP 3174, respectively). Sensitivity of the assay was < 10 
      ng/ml. Intra-and inter-assay variations were < 10 and 15%. respectively. The 
      assay has been successfully applied to measuring plasma concentrations of 
      losartan and EXP3174 in patients receiving a daily dose of losartan (50-100 mg). 
      CONCLUSION: The HPLC assay has adequate sensitivity, reproducibility, and 
      specificity for clinical pharmacokinetic studies.

AB  - Angiotensin II (Ang II) presents a critical mediator in various pathological 
      conditions such as non-genetic cardiomyopathy. Osmotic pump infusion in rodents 
      is a commonly used approach to model cardiomyopathy associated with Ang II. 
      However, profound differences in electrophysiology and pharmacokinetics between 
      rodent and human cardiomyocytes may limit predictability of animal-based 
      experiments. This study investigates the application of an Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) 
      system in modeling Ang II-induced progressive cardiomyopathy. The disease model 
      is constructed to recapitulate myocardial response to Ang II in a temporal 
      manner. The long-term tissue cultivation and non-invasive functional readouts 
      enable monitoring of both acute and chronic cardiac responses to Ang II 
      stimulation. Along with mapping of cytokine secretion and proteomic profiles, 
      this model presents an opportunity to quantitatively measure the dynamic 
      pathological changes that could not be otherwise identified in animals. Further, 
      we present this model as a testbed to evaluate compounds that target Ang 
      II-induced cardiac remodeling. Through assessing the effects of losartan, 
      relaxin, and saracatinib, the drug screening data implicated multifaceted 
      cardioprotective effects of relaxin in restoring contractile function and 
      reducing fibrotic remodeling. Overall, this study provides a controllable 
      platform where cardiac activities can be explicitly observed and tested over the 
      pathological process. The facile and high-content screening can facilitate the 
      evaluation of potential drug candidates in the pre-clinical stage.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor subtypes.
PG  - 406-10
AB  - The octapeptide, angiotensin II (Ang II), the biologically active component of 
      the renin-angiotensin system, elicits its multiple actions through the 
      stimulation of specific surface receptors on various target organs. Although the 
      existence of Ang II receptor subtypes has been suspected for some time, 
      definitive evidence for Ang II receptor heterogeneity has been obtained only with 
      the recently introduced nonpeptide Ang II receptor antagonists, exemplified by 
      the prototypic compounds DuP 753 and PD 123177. The sites having high affinity 
      for DuP 753 are designated as site 1 (AT1 receptors) and those having a high 
      affinity for PD 123177 as site 2 (AT2 receptors). Unlike Ang I, Ang II, Ang III, 
      and peptide antagonists, such as saralasin, which all are relatively nonselective 
      ligands for both Ang II receptors, the peptides CGP42112A and 
      p-aminophenylalanine6-Ang II show a marked preference for the AT2 site. The 
      occurrence of the AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes/binding sites identified so far 
      appears widespread. The presence and proportion of these receptors vary 
      significantly among different tissues/organs of the same species and within the 
      same tissue/organ of different species. Despite the abundance of the AT2 site, 
      its functional correlates remain to be determined. The DuP 753-sensitive site 
      (AT1 receptor) mediates all the major Ang II-induced biological effects, 
      including adrenal aldosterone and catecholamine secretion, release of 
      catecholamines from sympathetic ganglia, central nervous system responses, and 
      vasoconstriction.

TI  - Expanded role for ARBs in cardiovascular and renal disease? Recent observations 
      have far-reaching implications.
PG  - 115-22; quiz 9
AB  - The ARBs are a new class of drugs with broad therapeutic potential in 
      cardiovascular disease. These agents act by selectively inhibiting the AT1 
      subtype of the angiotensin II receptors. They are effective antihypertensive 
      agents with promise, theoretically, in the prevention and regression of 
      ventricular hypertrophy. They are safe and well tolerated in patients with CHF 
      and might be effective in improving survival and reducing morbidity. ARBs also 
      might have a similar role in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with 
      coronary artery disease and chronic nephropathy. Their precise role in the 
      treatment and prevention of cardiovascular and renal disease should be 
      established by several ongoing clinical trials.

      rabbit plasma and its application to pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 53-9
LID - 10.1002/bio.2689 [doi]
AB  - A new spectrofluorimetric method to determine losartan potassium (LP) in rabbit 
      plasma is described. The method was based on measuring the native fluorescence of 
      LP in acidic medium. Optimum excitation and emission wavelengths were found to be 
      248 nm and 410 nm, respectively, in methanol that was diluted with a sulfurous 
      acid solution LP was extracted from rabbit plasma by methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether 
      in acidic media and then back extracted with NaOH. The calibration curves were 
      linear between 0.025 and 0.5 µg/mL with a lower limit of detection 0.004 µg/mL. 
      Precision and accuracy values of the method were calculated as lower than 4.97% 
      and ± 5.68, respectively and the recovery of LP from rabbit plasma was higher 
      than 91.1%. In addition, stability studies of LP in rabbit plasma were carried 
      out and demonstrated its good stability at - 20 °C and at room temperature. The 
      developed and validated method was successfully applied for estimating the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of LP following oral administrations of a single 10 mg 
      LP/kg to rabbits and it could be concluded that the method can be applied to 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Comparative pharmacokinetics of two tablet formulations of Losartan: 
      bioequivalence assessment.
PG  - 205-10
AB  - The pharmacokinetic profiles of two brands of losartan 50 mg tablets were 
      compared in 24 healthy adult volunteers after a single oral dose in a randomized 
      cross-over study. The study was conducted at the ACDIMA Center for Bioequivalence 
      & Pharmaceutical Studies, Amman, Jordan. The reference (Cozaar, MSD, The 
      Netherlands) and test (Blosart, Julphar, UAE) products were administered to 
      fasting volunteers. Blood samples were collected at specified time intervals, and 
      the plasma separated and analysed for losartan and its active metabolite 
      (losartan carboxylic acid) using a validated HPLC method with fluorescence 
      detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-t), AUC(0-alpha), C(max), T(max), 
      T(1/2), elimination rate constant, MRT, Cl/F and Vss/F were determined from 
      plasma concentration-time profiles of both formulations and found to be in good 
      agreement with reported values. Three parameters (AUC(0-t), AUC(0-alpha), and 
      C(max)) were compared statistically to evaluate the bioequivalence between the 
      two brands, using statistical modules recommended by the FDA. Analysis of 
      variance (ANOVA) did not show any significant difference between the two 
      formulations and 90% confidence intervals fell within the acceptable range 
      (80%-125%) for bioequivalence. Based on these statistical inferences it was 
      concluded that the two formulations exhibited comparable pharmacokinetic profiles 
      and that Julphar's Blosart is bioequivalent to Cozaar of MSD, The Netherlands.

TI  - Does the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan improve cognitive function?
PG  - 723-32
AB  - Newer classes of antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists, may offer benefits to patients in addition to their ability to lower 
      blood pressure. It is accepted that chronic hypertension contributes to the 
      development of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, and several studies 
      have demonstrated a link between hypertension and reduced cognitive function, 
      especially in patients not receiving antihypertensive medication. In an initial 
      clinical trial, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan was shown to 
      improve cognitive function in patients with hypertension, including in those who 
      were elderly (up to 73 years of age). This effect cannot be explained by a 
      reduction in blood pressure alone and is likely to involve interactions with the 
      diverse biological actions of the renin-angiotensin system. Improving or 
      maintaining cognitive function in patients with hypertension may translate into 
      economic benefits beyond those expected due to blood pressure control, and would 
      result in considerable quality-of-life benefits for the aging population.

TI  - Evaluation of potential losartan-phenytoin drug interactions in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 238-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenytoin, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 substrate, has a narrow 
      therapeutic index and nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Therefore there is the 
      potential for significant concentration-related adverse effects when phenytoin is 
      coadministered with other CYP2C9 substrates. Losartan, an antihypertensive agent, 
      is also a substrate for CYP2C9. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the 
      effects of losartan on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin and the effects of 
      phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of losartan in a healthy population of 
      volunteers. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, 3-period crossover study was 
      conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with phenytoin alone, phenytoin in combination 
      with losartan, and losartan alone. Each treatment was given for 10 days with a 
      3-week washout period between treatments. On day 10, plasma concentrations of 
      phenytoin and plasma and urine concentrations of losartan and its active 
      carboxylic-acid metabolite E3174 were measured to determine steady-state 
      pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: Coadministration of losartan had no effect 
      on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin. Coadministration of phenytoin increased the 
      mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours 
      [AUC(0-24)] of losartan by 17% (355 +/- 220 ng x h/mL versus 427 +/- 177 ng x 
      h/mL; P =.1), but this difference was not statistically significant. In the 14 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects, the mean AUC(0-24) of losartan was increased by 29% (284 
      +/- 84 ng x h/mL versus 402 +/- 128 ng x h/mL; P =.008). Coadministration of 
      phenytoin significantly reduced the AUC(0-24) of E3174 by 63% (1254 +/- 256 ng x 
      h/mL versus 466 +/- 174 ng x h/mL; P =.0001) and the formation clearance of 
      losartan to E3174 (1.91 +/- 0.8 mL/h per kilogram versus 0.62 +/- 0.4 mL/h per 
      kilogram; P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Losartan, a CYP2C9 substrate, had no effect on 
      the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin. However, phenytoin inhibited the 
      CYP2C9-mediated conversion of losartan to E3174.

TI  - A Systematic Critical Review of Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Torasemide.
PG  - 309-320
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000001141 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Torasemide is a potassium-sparing loop diuretic used to treat fluid 
      retention associated with congestive heart failure and kidney and hepatic 
      diseases. This systematic review was conducted to combine all accessible data on 
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of torasemide in healthy and diseased populations, 
      which may help clinicians avert adverse drug reactions and determine the correct 
      dosage regimen. METHODS: Four databases were systematically searched to screen 
      for studies associated with the PK of torasemide, and 21 studies met the 
      eligibility criteria. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database 
      (CRD42023390178). RESULTS: A decrease in maximum plasma concentration (C max ) 
      was observed for torasemide after administration of the prolonged-release 
      formulation in comparison to that after administration of the immediate-release 
      formulation, that is, 1.12 ± 0.17 versus 1.6 ± 0.2 mcg/mL. After administering an 
      oral dose of torasemide, a 2-fold increase in the area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) was reported in patients with congestive heart 
      failure compared with the healthy population. Moreover, the patients with renal 
      failure (clearance < 30 mL/min) showed an increase in value of AUC 0-∞ that is, 
      42.9 versus 8.091 mcg.h -1 .mL -1 compared with healthy subjects. In addition, 
      some studies have reported interactions with different drugs, in which irbesartan 
      showed a slight increase in the AUC 0-∞ of torasemide, whereas losartan and 
      empagliflozin did not. CONCLUSIONS: The current review summarizes all available 
      PK parameters of torasemide that may be beneficial for avoiding drug-drug 
      interactions in subjects with renal and hepatic dysfunction and for predicting 
      doses in patients with different diseases.

TI  - Neuroprotective effects of AT1 receptor antagonists after experimental ischemic 
      stroke: what is important?
PG  - 949-959
LID - 10.1007/s00210-017-1395-y [doi]
AB  - The present study conducted in rats defines the requirements for neuroprotective 
      effects of systemically administered AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) in acute 
      ischaemic stroke. The inhibition of central effects to angiotensin II (ANG II) 
      after intravenous (i.v.) treatment with candesartan (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) or 
      irbesartan and losartan (3 and 30 mg/kg) was employed to study the penetration of 
      these ARBs across the blood-brain barrier. Verapamil and probenecid were used to 
      assess the role of the transporters, P-glycoprotein and the multidrug 
      resistance-related protein 2, in the entry of losartan and irbesartan into the 
      brain. Neuroprotective effects of i.v. treatment with the ARBs were investigated 
      after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min. The treatment 
      with the ARBs was initiated 3 h after the onset of MCAO and continued for two 
      consecutive days. Blood pressure was continuously recorded before and during MCAO 
      until 5.5 h after the onset of reperfusion. The higher dose of candesartan 
      completely abolished, and the lower dose of candesartan and higher doses of 
      irbesartan and losartan partially inhibited the drinking response to 
      intracerebroventricular ANG II. Only 0.3 mg/kg candesartan improved the recovery 
      from ischaemic stroke, and 3 mg/kg candesartan did not exert neuroprotective 
      effects due to marked blood pressure reduction during reperfusion. Both doses of 
      irbesartan and losartan had not any effect on the stroke outcome. An effective, 
      long-lasting blockade of brain AT1 receptors after systemic treatment with ARBs 
      without extensive blood pressure reductions is the prerequisite for 
      neuroprotective effects in ischaemic stroke.

TI  - Genetic variations of CYP2C9 in 724 Japanese individuals and their impact on the 
      antihypertensive effects of losartan.
PG  - 1549-57
LID - 10.1291/hypres.31.1549 [doi]
AB  - CYP2C9, a drug-metabolizing enzyme, converts the angiotensin II receptor blocker 
      losartan to its active form, which is responsible for its antihypertensive 
      effect. We resequenced CYP2C9 in 724 Japanese individuals, including 39 
      hypertensive patients under treatment with losartan. Of two novel missense 
      mutations identified, the Arg132Gln variant showed a fivefold lower intrinsic 
      clearance toward diclofenac when expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system, 
      while the Arg335Gln variant had no substantial effect. Several known missense 
      variations were also found, and approximately 7% of the Japanese individuals (53 
      out of 724) carried one of the deleterious alleles (CYP2C9*3, *13, *14, *30, and 
      Arg132Gln) as heterozygotes. After 3 months of losartan treatment, systolic blood 
      pressure was not lowered in two patients with CYP2C9* 1/*30, suggesting that they 
      exhibited impaired in vivo CYP2C9 activity. CYP2C9*30 might be associated with a 
      diminished response to the antihypertensive effects of losartan.

AB  - Angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) have demonstrated efficacy 
      similar to other classes of antihypertensive agents as well as "placebo-level" 
      tolerability at all doses. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies provide a 
      framework for understanding important intra-class dissimilarities. Disparity in 
      antagonistic effects may be determined by in vivo responses to challenges of 
      exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) and by ex vivo/in vitro responses to a drug's 
      biological activity by radioligand receptor assay (RRA). Two independent studies 
      have been conducted in which irbesartan exhibited a more pronounced and 
      longer-lasting antagonism to the effects of exogenous Ang II than losartan and 
      valsartan. Comparative trials have indicated that both irbesartan and candesartan 
      show greater clinical efficacy in lowering blood pressure than losartan. 
      Recently, we have compared the Ang II antagonistic properties of irbesartan 150 
      mg/day and candesartan 8 mg/day. Both drugs block AT1 receptors with 
      "insurmountable" antagonism and demonstrate a long duration of action. While both 
      irbesartan and candesartan showed a similar degree of antagonistic activity in 
      vivo, distinctly higher antagonistic activity in plasma was found for irbesartan 
      by RRA at all time-points. Furthermore, plasma renin activity during periods with 
      high antagonistic activity was significantly higher, and aldosterone levels 
      following Ang II stimulation were blunted to a greater extent, following 
      administration of irbesartan. In summary, in the doses tested, irbesartan 
      exhibits the strongest antagonism when compared with losartan, valsartan and 
      candesartan. This finding may have clinical implications.

TI  - Losartan attenuates the antimigratory effect of diclofenac in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats.
PG  - 190-9
AB  - Many patients with hypertension, particularly elderly patients, take nonsteroidal 
      antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihypertensive agents. However, few studies 
      describe the effect of the association of antihypertensive agents with NSAIDs on 
      inflammatory response in hypertension. To investigate this, spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with either diclofenac alone or diclofenac 
      combined with losartan (an AT1 angiotensin II antagonist). The 
      leukocyte-endothelial interaction was then observed using intravital microscopy. 
      Blood pressure of SHR (169.6+/-3.6) was increased by diclofenac (186.4+/-2.9), 
      reduced by losartan (152.6+/-3.5), and reduced by the combination of the 2 
      (158.9+/-3.7). All the treatments tested reduced the number of rollers, adherent 
      and migrated leukocytes, and the expression of endothelial intercellular adhesion 
      molecule-1 and P-selectin. The association of losartan reduced the effect of 
      diclofenac on leukocyte migration. Neither treatment tested increased the venular 
      shear rate or modified the venular diameters, number of circulating leukocytes, 
      and L-selectin expression on granulocytes. The reduction of CD11/CD18 expression 
      induced by diclofenac alone was hindered by losartan. A pharmacokinetic 
      interference between losartan and diclofenac was ruled out since no significant 
      differences were observed in the plasma concentrations of each drug when they 
      were associated. In conclusion, although diclofenac does not interfere with the 
      losartan antihypertensive effect, losartan attenuates the effect of diclofenac 
      has on leukocyte behavior and expression of adhesion molecules. Losartan has an 
      antimigratory effect, reducing leukocyte migration by reducing ICAM-1 and 
      P-selectin expression. Losartan may hinder the full expression of the 
      antimigratory effect of diclofenac.

PG  - 130-9
AB  - Over the past 4 years, six angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) were 
      approved for treating essential hypertension. They differ with respect to dosing, 
      metabolism, elimination, clinical efficacy, and investigational applications. 
      Candesartan cilexetil is the only prodrug among the agents. Losartan is 
      distinguished from other ARBs by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated 
      biotransformation to its active metabolite EXP-3174. No ARB requires dosage 
      adjustment for renal impairment, but the initial dose of losartan should be 
      reduced 50% in hepatically impaired patients. None of the drugs is significantly 
      cleared by hemodialysis. Completion of continuing trials will elucidate the 
      drugs' role in treating heart failure, cerebral stroke, and myocardial 
      infarction.

AB  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective and well-tolerated orally 
      active anti-hypertensive agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of typical ARBs in the dog. 60 beagles were 
      administered a single oral dose of Micardis® 80 mg (telmisartan), Cozaar® 50 mg 
      (losartan), or Diovan® 80- and 160-mg (valsartan). The plasma concentrations of 
      these ARBs were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and 
      their pharmacokinetic properties were analyzed using both non-compartmental and 
      compartmental approaches. The half-life and volume of distribution in dogs were 
      in the order losartan>valsartan>telmisartan after oral administration. Systemic 
      exposure was estimated by calculating the area under the plasma 
      concentration-vs.-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC inf ), and resulted 
      in the order telmisartan>valsartan>losartan. The values of C max and AUC 
      increased in proportion to the dose of valsartan. In compartmental analysis, the 
      pharmacokinetics of telmisartan and losartan pharmacokinetics fit a 2-compartment 
      model, while valsartan fit a 1-compartment model. These results provide detailed 
      pharmacokinetic information of ARBs in the dog, and may aid in future development 
      of improved formulations or fixed-dose combinations.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor antagonists in arterial hypertension.
PG  - S69-72
AB  - Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AT-1) represent a new group of orally active 
      antihypertensive agents. Activation on AT-1 receptor leads to vasoconstriction, 
      stimulation of the release of catecholamines and antidiuretic hormone with 
      production of thirst, and promote growth of vascular and cardiac muscle; these 
      effects are blocked by AT-1 antagonist agents. The first chemically useful, 
      orally active AT-1 receptor antagonist was losartan, followed by other agents 
      currently in clinical use, such as: valsartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, 
      telmisartan, candesartan, and many others under investigation. AT-1 receptor 
      antagonists are effective in reducing high blood pressure in hypertensive 
      patients. Monotherapy in mild to moderate hypertension controls blood pressure in 
      40 to 50% of these patients; when a low dose of a thiazide diuretic is added, 60 
      to 70% of patients are controlled. The efficacy is similar to 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, calcium antagonists and 
      beta-blocking agents. Tolerability has been reported to be very good. AT-1 
      receptor antagonists would be a drug of choice in otherwise well-controlled 
      hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors who 
      developed cough or angioedema. The final position in the antihypertensive therapy 
      in this special population and other clinical situations, such as left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and renal disease, has 
      to be determined in large prospective clinical trials, some of which are now 
      being conducted.

TI  - Characterization of 18F-FPyKYNE-Losartan for Imaging AT1 Receptors.
PG  - 1612-1617
AB  - Most physiologic effects of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) are mediated via 
      the angiotensin (Ang) type 1 receptor (AT(1)R). The (18)F-FPyKYNE derivative of 
      the clinically used AT(1)R blocker losartan exhibits high binding selectivity for 
      kidney AT(1)R and rapid metabolism in rats. The aim of this study was to further 
      assess the binding profile of this novel PET agent for imaging AT(1)R in rats and 
      pigs. METHODS: In vitro binding assays were performed with (18)F-FPyKYNE-losartan 
      in rat kidneys. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to assess dosimetry, 
      antagonistic efficacy via blood pressure measurements, and presence of labeled 
      metabolites in kidneys. Test-retest PET imaging, blocking with AT(1)R antagonist 
      candesartan (10 mg/kg), and plasma metabolism analysis were performed in female 
      Yorkshire pigs. RESULTS: (18)F-FPyKYNE-losartan bound with high affinity 
      (dissociation constant of 49.4 ± 18.0 nM and maximal binding of 348 ± 112 
      fmol/mm(2)) to rat kidney AT(1)R. It bound strongly to plasma proteins in rats 
      (97%), and its labeled metabolites displayed minimal interference on renal AT(1)R 
      binding. FPyKYNE-losartan fully antagonized the Ang II pressor effect, albeit 
      with 4-fold potency reduction (the effective dose inhibiting 50% of the Ang 
      II-induced maximal pressor response of 25.5 mg/kg) relative to losartan. PET 
      imaging exhibited high kidney-to-blood contrast and slow renal clearance, with an 
      SUV of 14.1 ± 6.2. Excellent reproducibility was observed in the calculated 
      test-retest variability (7.2% ± 0.75%). Only hydrophilic-labeled metabolites were 
      present in plasma samples, and renal retention was reduced (-60%) at 10-15 min 
      after blockade with candesartan. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPyKYNE-losartan has a 
      favorable binding profile and displays high potential for translational work in 
      humans as an AT(1)R PET imaging agent.

TI  - Role of CYP2C9 polymorphism in losartan oxidation.
PG  - 1051-6
AB  - Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is oxidized by hepatic 
      cytochromes P450 to an active carboxylic acid metabolite, E-3174. The aim of the 
      present investigation was to study the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in 
      losartan oxidation in vitro and to evaluate the role of CYP2C9 polymorphism. 
      Kinetic properties of different genetic CYP2C9 variants were compared both in a 
      yeast expression system and in 25 different samples of human liver microsomes 
      where all known genotypes of CYP2C9 were represented. Microsomes were incubated 
      with losartan (0.05-50 microM), and the formation of E-3174 was analyzed by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography to estimate V(max), K(m), and intrinsic 
      clearance for all individual samples. Sulfaphenazole, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, blocked 
      the formation of E-3174 at low losartan concentrations (<1 microM), whereas the 
      inhibitory effect of triacetyloleandomycin, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, was significant 
      only at high concentrations of losartan (>25 microM). In comparison to the 
      CYP2C9.1 variant, oxidation of losartan was significantly reduced in yeast 
      expressing the rare CYP2C9.2 or CYP2C9.3 variants. Moreover, the rate of losartan 
      oxidation was lower in liver microsomes from individuals hetero- or homozygous 
      for the CYP2C9*3 allele, or homozygous for the CYP2C9*2 allele. The difference 
      between the common and rare CYP2C9 variants was mainly explained by a lower 
      V(max), both in yeast and human liver microsomes. In summary, these in vitro 
      results indicate that CYP2C9 is the major human P450 isoenzyme responsible for 
      losartan oxidation and that the CYP2C9 genotype contributes to interindividual 
      differences in losartan oxidation and activation.

TI  - Search for the molecular basis of ultra-rapid CYP2C9-catalysed metabolism: 
      relationship between SNP IVS8-109A>T and the losartan metabolism phenotype in 
      Swedes.
PG  - 1033-42
LID - 10.1007/s00228-012-1210-0 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To search for a relationship between ultra-rapid metabolism catalysed by 
      cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and its genotypes. METHODS: DNA from a Swedish 
      ultra-rapid metaboliser patient [losartan metabolic ratio (MR) <0.13] and three 
      healthy Swedes with normal CYP2C9 activity and a MR of about 1 were assessed for 
      variation in the CYP2C9 gene. Direct DNA sequencing was performed for all exons 
      and exon-intron junctions and also for -2100 bp of the 5′-flanking regions of the 
      CYP2C9 gene. This analysis revealed four intronic mutations [single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) 1-4] in the three samples with normal MR while no variation 
      was observed in the ultra-rapid metaboliser. PCR/restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism and allele-specific PCR methods were subsequently developed to 
      screen 85 Swedes and 128 Koreans without CYP2C9*2 or *3. RESULTS: We found a 
      significant relationship between SNP 4 (IVS8-109A>T) and CYP2C9 activity 
      (χ²-test, p=0.011) in the Swedes. Twenty Swedes with the lowest MR were compared 
      with 20 Swedes with the highest MR, revealing a strong association (p00.001) 
      between SNP4 and higher MR. For homozygous SNP 1 (IVS1+83T>C), SNP 2 
      (IVS2+73T>C), and SNP 3 (IVS6+95A>G), no phenotype and genotype relationships 
      were found, but theMRwas generally higher among the Swedes compared to the 
      Koreans (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the SNP 4 
      IVS8-109T allele is associated with a higher CYP2C9 MR in healthy Swedish 
      subjects, but further investigations need to be carried out to establish a 
      molecular explanation for ultra-rapid CYP2C9- catalysed metabolism. Haplotype 
      based on SNPs 1-4 did not seem to contribute to variation in the MR of the Korean 
      subjects nor play a role in determining the MR of the Swedish ones.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized to cause pharmacokinetic changes in 
      renally excreted drugs; however, pharmacokinetic changes are also reported for 
      drugs that are nonrenally eliminated. Few studies have investigated how uremic 
      toxins may affect drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes and how these may 
      result in pharmacokinetic/metabolic changes in CKD. Here, we investigated the 
      effects of uremic toxins and human uremic serum on the transport of the 
      prototypical transporter substrate [(3) H]-estrone sulfate and three 
      Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) drugs, 
      propranolol, losartan, and eprosartan. We observed a significant decrease in [(3) 
      H]-estrone sulfate, losartan, and eprosartan uptake with some uremic toxins in 
      both transfected cells and rat hepatocytes. The uptake of losartan was decreased 
      in rat and human hepatocytes (28% and 48%, respectively) in the presence of 
      hemodialysis (HD) serum. Time-course studies of losartan showed a 27%, 65%, and 
      68% increase in area under the curve (AUC) in the presence of HD serum, rifampin, 
      and sulfaphenazole, respectively. Intracellular losartan AUC decreased 
      significantly in the treatment groups, and the metabolite AUC decreased by 41% 
      and 26% in rifampin- and sulfaphenazole-treated group, respectively. The 
      intracellular AUC of eprosartan increased 190% in the presence of HD serum. These 
      studies indicate that the uremic toxins contained in HD serum play an important 
      role in drug disposition through drug transporters, and that there would be 
      differential effects depending on the BDDCS classification of the drug.

TI  - The comparative pharmacology of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
PG  - 6-11
AB  - Several orally active non-peptide angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor 
      antagonists are now available for the treatment of hypertension. These agents 
      have a common mechanism of action--blockade of the binding of angiotensin II to 
      the subtype 1 receptor--and their binding to this receptor is generally 
      insurmountable. There are some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences 
      between these antagonists, which may reflect in their clinical efficacy, 
      especially at the end of the dosing interval. Losartan has an active metabolite 
      that prolongs its duration of action, and candesartan cilexetil requires 
      conversion to an active form after administration. Telmisartan has the longest 
      duration of action, with a terminal elimination half-life of around 24 h in 
      comparison with 11-15 h for irbesartan, the agent with the next longest 
      half-life. The long duration of action and insurmountable binding to the receptor 
      may be related to the slow dissociation kinetics of the antagonists from the AT1 
      receptor. Comparative clinical studies suggest that at the recommended dose 
      losartan, the original drug in this class, has a lower antihypertensive efficacy 
      than the newer agents, such as telmisartan. It is possible that these differences 
      between angiotensin II receptor antagonists are due to variations in the degree 
      and duration of receptor blockade, and may be of clinical significance with 
      regard to the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of this class of 
      antihypertensive agents.

TI  - Are there differences among angiotensin receptor blockers?
PG  - 231S-235S
AB  - Pharmacologic effects of specific drugs are frequently attributed to their 
      therapeutic class because all agents within a particular class have the same 
      mechanism of action. Because "head-to-head" comparisons in trials are rare, any 
      differentiation between drugs of the same class is usually limited to comparisons 
      of their pharmacokinetic profiles, and it is usually assumed that most of the 
      drugs in a therapeutic class have similar efficacies. Two recent randomized 
      clinical trials demonstrated that the antihypertensive agents irbesartan and 
      losartan, both angiotensin receptor blockers, are not equally effective in 
      reducing blood pressure among patients with hypertension. In both a fixed-dose 
      trial and a titration-protocol trial, patients treated with irbesartan achieved a 
      greater reduction in blood pressure than did those treated with losartan. The 
      response rate was also higher among patients treated with irbesartan. Therefore, 
      irbesartan, used either alone or as a component of response-based combination 
      therapy with a diuretic, is a more potent antihypertensive agent than losartan. 
      These results and the previously published pharmacologic profiles of these drugs 
      demonstrate that angiotensin receptor blockers are, like many other classes of 
      antihypertensive agents, more different than alike.

AB  - We established a novel mouse model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using acetic 
      acid and compared it with the 5/6-nephrectomized mouse model. In our novel model, 
      significant increases were observed in blood biochemical values and urinary 
      parameters. Moreover, a decrease in creatinine clearance (Ccr) was observed. This 
      model also demonstrated a higher survival rate than the 5/6-nephrectomized model. 
      Observed histological changes in our model included cell infiltration in the 
      renal interstitium, tubular dilation, regenerated tubules, and 
      glomerulosclerosis. Inflammation of the renal interstitium was particularly 
      remarkable. TNF-α, IL-1β, and ICAM-1 mRNA expression were up-regulated prior to 
      elevation of mean blood pressure and prior to changes in blood biochemical values 
      and urinary parameters. Up-regulation of TGF-β mRNA and down-regulation of 
      nephrin mRNA were also observed at 12 weeks after acetic acid treatment. However, 
      no correlation between the progression of CKD and the decrease in renal blood 
      flow was observed. Finally, repeated losartan administration attenuated the 
      effects of acetic acid-induced renal injury. Our findings suggest that chronic 
      kidney conditions associated with this model may be triggered by interstitial 
      inflammation. Moreover, we suggest that this model is useful for understanding 
      the pathophysiological mechanisms of CKD, and for evaluating the effects of 
      therapeutic agents.

AB  - Novel rapid and sensitive HPLC assays were developed to simultaneously determine 
      losartan and its main active metabolite EXP 3174 in biological material of humans 
      and rats following solid-phase or liquid-liquid extraction. The analytes were 
      separated on a 3 microm particle-sized ULTREMEX CN column, which was preceded by 
      a 5 microm particle-sized guard column, using UV-detection at 245 nm. The assays 
      provided high sensitivity with limits of quantification (LoQ) of 5 ng ml(-1) for 
      both compounds in human and rat plasma and 10 ng ml(-1) in human and rat urine, 
      respectively. In rat blood, bile and various tissues, limits of quantifications 
      were achieved that ranged 10-15 ng per ml and per 100 mg tissue, respectively, 
      for both analytes.

AB  - To clarify the role of gene polymorphisms on the effect of losartan and losartan 
      plus hydrochlorothiazide on blood pressure (primary end point) and on cardiac, 
      vascular and metabolic phenotypes (secondary end point) after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 48 
      weeks treatment, an Italian collaborative study - The Study of the 
      Pharmacogenomics in Italian hypertensive patients treated with the Angiotensin 
      receptor blocker losartan (SOPHIA) - on never-treated essential hypertensives (n 
      = 800) was planned. After an 8 week run-in, losartan 50 mg once daily will be 
      given and doubled to 100 mg at week +4 if blood pressure is more than 140/90 
      mmHg. Hydroclorothiazide 25 mg once daily at week +8 and amlodipine 5 mg at week 
      +16 will be added if blood pressure is more than 140/90 mmHg. Cardiac mass 
      (echocardiography), carotid intima-media thickness, 24 h ambulatory blood 
      pressure, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, microalbuminuria, plasma 
      renin activity and aldosterone, endogenous lithium clearance, brain natriuretic 
      peptide and losartan metabolites will be evaluated. Genes of the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, salt sensitivity, the beta-adrenergic 
      system and losartan metabolism will be studied (Illumina custom arrays). A 
      whole-genome scan will also be performed in half of the study cohort (1M array, 
      Illumina 500 GX beadstation).

TI  - Irbesartan. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and 
      therapeutic use in the management of hypertension.
PG  - 885-902
AB  - Irbesartan inhibits the activity of angiotensin II (AII) via specific, selective 
      noncompetitive antagonism of the AII receptor subtype 1 (AT1) which mediates most 
      of the known physiological activities of AII. In patients with mild to moderate 
      hypertension, once daily administration of irbesartan 150 or 300 mg, with or 
      without adjunctive antihypertensive agents, provides effective 24-hour BP 
      control. Irbesartan reduced BP to a similar extent to enalapril and atenolol and 
      to a significantly greater extent than losartan. The combination of irbesartan 
      and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. The drug 
      is effective in the elderly and dosage adjustment is not required in these 
      patients or in those with renal or hepatic failure. Preliminary studies 
      evaluating the efficacy of irbesartan in patients with heart failure have 
      produced encouraging results. Irbesartan is very well tolerated and neither the 
      frequency nor the pattern of adverse events differed from those seen in placebo 
      recipients, although headache was significantly more frequent with the latter. 
      Similarly, the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between 
      irbesartan and enalapril in patients who received either drug as monotherapy. 
      Headache, upper-respiratory tract infection and musculoskeletal pain were the 
      most common complaints. Thus, irbesartan is an effective therapy for patients 
      with mild to moderate hypertension and had an adverse event profile similar to 
      that of placebo in clinical trials. On this basis it would appear to be an 
      effective therapeutic option in this indication.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor-independent antiinflammatory and antiaggregatory 
      properties of losartan: role of the active metabolite EXP3179.
PG  - 770-6
AB  - Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT(1)) antagonists such as losartan 
      (LOS) are widely used for the treatment of hypertension and elicit 
      antiinflammatory and antiaggregatory in vitro and in patients, although the 
      underlying mechanism are unclear. Following computer-based molecule similarity, 
      we proposed that on cytochrome-P450 degradation, the LOS metabolite EXP3179 is 
      generated, which shows molecule homology to indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase 
      inhibitor with antiinflammatory and antiaggregatory properties. Subsequently, 
      serum-levels of EXP3179 were determined for 8 hours in patients receiving a 
      single oral dose of 100 mg LOS. High-performance liquid chromatography followed 
      by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [corrected] from serum samples 
      revealed a maximum of 10(-7) mol/L for EXP3179 peaking between 3 to 4 hours. The 
      increase in serum-EXP3179 levels was associated with a significant reduction in 
      platelet aggregation in vivo (-35+/-4%, P<0.001 versus control). EXP3179 
      generation was investigated in a chemical reaction mimicking the liver 
      cytochrome-P450-dependent LOS-degradation and human endothelial cells were 
      exposed to Ang II or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the presence of EXP3179 (10(-7) 
      mol/L). LPS- and Ang II-induced COX-2 transcription was abolished by EXP3179. 
      Moreover, EXP3179 significantly reduced Ang II- and LPS-induced formation of 
      prostaglandin F2alpha as determined by GC-MS [corrected]. Thus, antiinflammatory 
      properties of LOS are mediated via its EXP3179 metabolite by abolishing COX-2 
      mRNA upregulation and COX-dependent TXA2 and PGF2alpha generation. Serum levels 
      of EXP3179 are detectable in patients in concentrations that exhibit 
      antiinflammatory and antiaggregatory properties in vitro.

AB  - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) have become an important drug 
      class in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure and the protection from 
      diabetic nephropathy. Eight ARBs are clinically available [azilsartan, 
      candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, 
      valsartan]. Azilsartan (in some countries), candesartan, and olmesartan are 
      orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated 
      through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use 
      different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences 
      in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. 
      The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue 
      penetration, including passage through the blood-brain barrier. Differences in 
      binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in 
      pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally 
      highly specific for angiotensin II type 1 receptors, some ARBs, particularly 
      telmisartan, are partial agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-γ. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. 
      Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 
      24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological 
      differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.

TI  - Angiotensin II antagonists: a new class of antihypertensive agent.
PG  - 265-8
AB  - Losartan is an orally active angiotensin II antangonist that selectively blocks 
      effects mediated by the stimulation of the AT1 subtype of the angiotensin II 
      receptor. This agent, at doses of 50-150mg/day, is as effective at lowering blood 
      pressure as chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Losartan is 
      generally well tolerated and has an incidence of adverse effects very similar, in 
      double-blind controlled trials, to that of placebo. It does not cause coughing, 
      the most common side-effect of the ACE inhibitors, most probably because 
      angiotensin II antagonism has no impact on ACE, an enzyme known to process 
      bradykinin and other cough-inducing peptides. Losartan is a promising 
      antihypertensive agent with the potential to become a first-line option for the 
      treatment of patients with high blood pressure.

TI  - Chronic treatment with losartan results in sufficient serum levels of the 
      metabolite EXP3179 for PPARgamma activation.
PG  - 738-43
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.132886 [doi]
AB  - The losartan metabolite EXP3174 exhibits angiotensin II receptor 1 
      (AT1R)-blocking properties, whereas the metabolite EXP3179 potently induces the 
      activity of the insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma (PPARgamma) as a partial agonist in vitro. We investigated whether chronic 
      treatment with losartan leads to sufficient serum levels of EXP3179 to activate 
      PPARgamma in monocytes derived from losartan-treated patients. Hypertensive 
      patients (n=15) treated with losartan (100 mg/daily for at least the past 2 
      months) and untreated control patients (n=7) were included. Monocytes were 
      extracted by negative isolation using a Dynal Monocyte Kit, followed by analysis 
      of PPARgamma target gene expression (CD36, ABC transporter G1 [ABCG1]) by 
      quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Serum was prepared before, 2, 4, and 6 hours after 
      losartan (100 mg) ingestion for HPLC-based determination of losartan, EXP3174, 
      and EXP3179. Chronic treatment with losartan resulted in basal levels of 
      losartan, EXP3174, and EXP3179 of 348.3+/-101.8 ng/mL, 115.3+/-56.1 ng/mL, and 
      176.2+/-143.4 ng/mL, respectively. Levels of both EXP3174 and EXP3179 were 
      time-dependently increased in serum with a maximum 2 hours after drug intake 
      (1706.0+/-760.1 ng/mL, 808.9+/-618.2 ng/mL, respectively). In consonance with 
      detectable PPARgamma-activating EXP3179 serum levels, monocytic PPARgamma target 
      gene expression was significantly upregulated in patients treated with losartan 
      by 3.75+/-0.95- and 252.02+/-46.86-fold for CD36 and ABCG1 (P=0.043, P=0.0045 
      versus control patients, respectively). This is the first clinical description of 
      monocytic PPARgamma-target gene regulation by chronic treatment with losartan, 
      which likely is mediated by its metabolite EXP3179. Our data show that sufficient 
      serum levels of EXP3179 are present under losartan treatment. PPARgamma 
      activation by AT1R-blockers may translate into synergistic beneficial actions in 
      monocytes.

PG  - 1584-91
LID - 10.1002/jps.23965 [doi]
AB  - Estimation of metabolite data as a supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic 
      outcome is recommended by various guidance documents. However, a consensus on 
      using it solely to establish bioequivalence (BE) is lacking as parent drug is 
      believed to detect pharmacokinetic differences between test and reference 
      formulations better. Four BE studies of losartan potassium reported in the 
      literature are reviewed. In all the four studies, 90% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      of geometric mean ratios of the test and reference formulations for maximum blood 
      drug concentration (Cmax ) of losartan potassium were outside the acceptable 
      range of 80%-125%, whereas, 90% CIs for its active metabolite, losartan 
      carboxylic acid (LCA), were within the acceptance criteria. Although BE with 
      respect to area under the plasma concentration versus time profile curve was 
      demonstrated in all the cases, BE with respect to Cmax could not be established. 
      However, marketing authorization in all the four cases was granted based on 
      scientific evidence that LCA is 10-40 times more potent than losartan, LCA 
      exhibited higher plasma concentration levels than losartan, pharmacodynamic 
      effects correlate with LCA, and losartan shows wide therapeutic index. Further, 
      widened CI limits for losartan were accepted. Losartan presents an opportunity in 
      the diligence of the principles of quality risk management for selecting moiety 
      on which BE decision must be based.

TI  - Human plasma protein binding of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan 
      potassium (DuP 753/MK 954) and its pharmacologically active metabolite EXP3174.
PG  - 515-20
AB  - The in vitro protein binding characteristics of the prototypical angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonist losartan potassium (DuP 753/MK 954) and its pharmacologically 
      active metabolite EXP3174 were determined by ultrafiltration with plasma from 
      naive donors, volunteers dosed with losartan, and purified human plasma proteins. 
      The binding of losartan was high, with a percent unbound (free) of 1.4 +/- 0.2% 
      to 1.2 +/- 0.1% at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 micrograms/mL; that is, 
      approximately 98.6 to 98.8% bound. EXP3174 was more highly bound than losartan (P 
      < .05) with 0.2 +/- 0.0% free at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 
      micrograms/mL; or, greater than 99.7% bound. The binding in the plasma from 
      volunteers given oral losartan was similar to that determined with plasma from 
      naive donors, with 1.5 +/- 0.3 versus 1.4 +/- 0.1% free for losartan, and 0.5 +/- 
      0.1 versus 0.4 +/- 0.0% for EXP3174, respectively. This extensive plasma binding 
      of both acidic compounds occurs primarily to albumin, with negligible binding to 
      the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Although highly bound, neither losartan nor 
      EXP3174 were displaced in vitro by pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 
      non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, or diazepam; however, 
      suprapharmacologic concentrations of the NSAIDs increased the free fraction of 
      both compounds. These data show that the angiotensin II receptor antagonists 
      losartan and EXP3174 are highly bound to plasma albumin in humans, although 
      clinically significant drug interactions due to displacement from binding sites 
      are unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - New therapeutic agents in the management of hypertension: angiotensin II-receptor 
      antagonists and renin inhibitors.
PG  - 1495-503
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials of two 
      new classes of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and 
      renin inhibitors. DATA SOURCES: Primary literature on angiotensin II-receptor 
      antagonists and renin inhibitors was identified through a comprehensive medical 
      literature search from 1961 through 1993. This search included journal articles, 
      abstracts, and reports of both animal and human research published in the English 
      language. Indexing terms included renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, renin 
      inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, DuP 753, losartan, MK954, A-64662, and Ro 
      42-5892. STUDY SELECTIONS: Emphasis was placed on clinical and pharmacokinetic 
      studies in humans for drugs that are currently in Phase I-III research protocols 
      in the US. DATA EXTRACTION: All available data from human studies were reviewed. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and renin inhibitors may be 
      effective antihypertensives with few adverse effects noted in the small studies 
      completed. Their potential advantage over angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
      inhibitors includes a possible smaller adverse effect profile. In the past, the 
      clinical utility of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and renin inhibitors has 
      been limited because of poor oral bioavailability, although newer agents are more 
      readily bioavailable. CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and renin 
      inhibitors may be the next new classes of antihypertensives marketed. However, 
      definitive conclusions about their roles in the management of hypertension are 
      not possible until larger clinical trials assessing their efficacy and safety and 
      comparing them with ACE inhibitors are completed.

AB  - The circadian timing system (CTS) governs the 24-h rhythm of the organism and, 
      hence, also main pathways responsible for drug pharmacokinetics. P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) is a drug transporter that plays a pivotal role in drug absorption, 
      distribution, and elimination, and temporal changes in its activity may affect 
      input, output, activity, and toxicity profile of drugs. In the current study, the 
      influence of different circadian stages on the overall intestinal permeability 
      (P(eff)) of the P-gp substrates talinolol and losartan was evaluated in in situ 
      intestinal perfusion studies in rats. Additionally, in vivo studies in rats were 
      performed by employing the P-gp probe talinolol during the day (nonactive) and 
      night (active) period in rats. Effective intestinal permeabilities of talinolol 
      and losartan were smaller in studies performed during the night (p < .05), 
      indicating that P-gp-dependent intestinal secretion is greater during the 
      nighttime activity span than daytime rest span of the animals. P-gp modulators 
      vinblastine and PSC833 led to a significant decrease of talinolol and losartan 
      exsorption in the intestinal segments as compared with control groups. 
      Strikingly, the permeability-enhancing effect of vinblastine and PSC833 was 
      higher with night perfusions, for both talinolol and losartan. In vivo studies 
      performed with talinolol revealed-consistent with the in situ studies (P(eff) day 
      > night)-a day vs. night difference in the oral availability of talinolol in the 
      group of male rats in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) data (AUC(day) > 
      AUC(night)). The P-gp modulator vinblastine significantly increased talinolol 
      AUC(day) (p < .05), whereas only a weak vinblastine effect was seen in night. 
      According to the in situ data, the functional activity of P-gp was regulated by 
      the CTS in jejunum and ileum, which are major intestinal segments for 
      energy-dependent efflux. In conclusion, circadian rhythms may affect 
      carrier-mediated active efflux and play a role in the absorption process. In 
      addition to daily rhythms in P-gp activity in rat intestine, the in vivo studies 
      indicate that absorption-, distribution-, metabolism-, and elimination-relevant 
      rhythms may be involved in the circadian kinetics of the drug, besides 
      transporter-dependent efflux, such well-known aspects as metabolic or renal 
      clearance or motility. Since this also holds true for a potentially interacting 
      second compound (modulator), modulator effects should be evaluated carefully in 
      transporter related drug-drug interactions.

TI  - Angiotensin receptors and their therapeutic implications.
PG  - 281-306
AB  - Angiotensin II is a multifunctional hormone that exerts its effects by 
      interacting will cell surface receptors. Two major subtypes of receptors (AT1 and 
      AT2) have been distinguished by pharmacological and molecular biological 
      techniques. AT1 receptors have been further subdivided into AT1A and AT1B 
      receptors. Several other isoforms have been found, notably in nonmammalian 
      systems, but further information is necessary before definitive classification 
      can be made. AT1 receptors mediate most known functions of angiotensin II, while 
      AT2 receptors may be important developmentally. The molecular, structural, and 
      biochemical characteristics of these receptors have been described, as well as 
      the factors that regulate their expression. This receptor system has been 
      implicated in several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, restenosis 
      after angioplasty, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and 
      ventricular remodeling. Structural analysis of AT receptors may provide the basis 
      for the development of new therapeutic agents with enhanced specificity for the 
      treatment of these diseases.

TI  - The role of CYP2C9 genotype in the metabolism of diclofenac in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 729-35
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C9 (CYP2C9) catalyses the 
      metabolism of many drugs including S-warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenytoin, 
      tolbutamide, losartan and most of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
      Diclofenac is metabolised to 4'-hydroxy (OH), the major diclofenac metabolite, 
      3'-OH and 3'-OH-4'-methoxy metabolites by CYP2C9. The aim of the present study 
      was to clarify the impact of the CYP2C9 polymorphism on the metabolism of 
      diclofenac both in vivo and in vitro. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 
      healthy volunteers with different CYP2C9 genotypes [i.e. CYP2C9*1/ *1 (n = 6), 
      *1/*2 (n = 3), *1,/*3 (n = 5), *2/*3 (n = 4), *21*2 (n = 1), *31*3 (n = 1)] 
      received a single 50-mg oral dose of diclofenac. Plasma pharmacokinetics [peak 
      plasma concentration (Cmax), half-life (t 1/2) and area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUCtotal)] and urinary recovery of diclofenac and its 
      metabolites were compared between the genotypes. Diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation was 
      also analysed in vitro in 16 different samples of genotyped [i.e. CYP2C9*1/*1 (n 
      = 7), *1/*2 (n=2), *1/*3 (n = 2), *2/*3 (n = 2), *2/*2 (n = 2), *31/*3 (n = 1)] 
      human liver microsomes. RESULTS: Within each genotype group, a high variability 
      was observed in kinetic parameters for diclofenac and 4'-OH-diclofenac (6- and 
      20-fold, respectively). No significant differences were found between the 
      different genotypes either in vivo or in human liver microsomes. No correlation 
      was found between the plasma AUC ratio of diclofenac/4'-OH-diclofenac and that of 
      losartan/ E-3174, previously determined in the same subjects. CONCLUSION: No 
      relationship was found between the CYP2C9 genotype and the 4'-hydroxylation of 
      diclofenac either in vivo or in vitro. This, together with the lack of 
      correlation between losartan oxidation and diclofenac hydroxylation in vivo 
      raises the question about the usefulness of diclofenac as a CYP2C9 probe.

TI  - The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A3 is highly selective towards N2 in 
      the tetrazole ring of losartan, candesartan, and zolarsartan.
PG  - 763-72
LID - 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.07.006 [doi]
AB  - Losartan, candesartan, and zolarsartan are AT(1) receptor antagonists that 
      inhibit the effect of angiotensin II. We have examined their glucuronidation by 
      liver microsomes from several animals and by recombinant human 
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Large differences in the production of 
      different glucuronide regioisomers of the three sartans were observed among liver 
      microsomes from human (HLM), rabbit, rat, pig, moose, and bovine. However, all 
      the liver microsomes produced one or two N-glucuronides in which either N1 or N2 
      of the tetrazole ring were conjugated. O-Glucuronides were also detected, 
      including acyl glucuronides of zolarsartan and candesartan. Examination of 
      individual human UGTs of subfamilies 1A and 2B revealed that N-glucuronidation 
      activity is widespread, along with variable regioselectivity with respect to the 
      tetrazole nitrogens of these sartans. Interestingly, UGT1A3 exhibited a strong 
      regioselectivity towards the N2 position of the tetrazole ring in all three 
      sartans. Moreover, the tetrazole-N2 of zolarsartan was only conjugated by UGT1A3, 
      whereas the tetrazole-N1 of this aglycone was accessible to other enzymes, 
      including UGT1A5. Zolarsartan O-glucuronide was mainly produced by UGTs 1A10 and 
      2B7. UGT2B7, alongside UGT1A3, glucuronidated candesartan at the tetrazole-N2 
      position, whereas UGTs 1A7-1A10 mainly yielded candesartan O-glucuronide. In the 
      case of losartan, no O-glucuronide was generated by any tested human enzyme. 
      Nevertheless, UGTs 1A1, 1A3, 1A10, 2B7, and 2B17 glucuronidated losartan at the 
      tetrazole-N2, while UGT1A10 also yielded the respective N1-glucuronide. Kinetic 
      analyses revealed that the main contributors to losartan glucuronidation in HLM 
      are UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. The results provide ample new data on substrate 
      specificity in drug glucuronidation.

AB  - Purpose: Red ginseng is one of the world's most popular herbal medicines; it 
      exhibits a wide range of pharmacologic activities and is often co-ingested with 
      other herbal and conventional medicines. This open-label, randomized, 3-period 
      study investigated the in vivo herb-drug interaction potential for red ginseng 
      extract with cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes and organic anion-transporting 
      polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. METHODS: Fifteen healthy male volunteers (22-28 years; 
      57.1-80.8 kg) were administered a single dose of cocktail probe substrates 
      (caffeine 100 mg, losartan 50 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, dextromethorphan 30 mg, 
      midazolam 2 mg, and pitavastatin 2 mg) and single or multiple doses of red 
      ginseng extract for 15 days. FINDINGS: The pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe 
      substrates and metabolites after single- or multiple-dose administration of red 
      ginseng extracts were comparable to the corresponding profiles of the control 
      group. The geometric mean ratio of AUC(0-t) and 90% CIs for the probe substrate 
      drugs between the control and multiple doses of red ginseng for 15 days were 
      within 0.8 to 1.25 (CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and OATP1B1 probe substrates) or slightly 
      higher (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 probe substrates). Additional assessments of 
      the in vitro drug interaction potential of red ginseng extracts and the 
      ginsenoside Rb1 on drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters using human liver 
      microsomes, cryopreserved human hepatocytes, and transporter-overexpressed cells 
      were negative. IMPLICATIONS: Red ginseng poses minimal risks for clinically 
      relevant CYP- or OATP-mediated drug interactions and is well tolerated. Clinical 
      Research Information Service registry no.

AB  - Advanced hepatic fibrosis therapy using drug-delivering nanoparticles is a 
      relatively unexplored area. Angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers such as 
      losartan can be delivered to hepatic stellate cells (HSC), blocking their 
      activation and thereby reducing fibrosis progression in the liver. In our study, 
      we analyzed the possibility of utilizing drug-loaded vehicles such as hyaluronic 
      acid (HA) micelles carrying losartan to attenuate HSC activation. Losartan, which 
      exhibits inherent lipophilicity, was loaded into the hydrophobic core of HA 
      micelles with a 19.5% drug loading efficiency. An advanced liver fibrosis model 
      was developed using C3H/HeN mice subjected to 20 weeks of prolonged TAA/ethanol 
      weight-adapted treatment. The cytocompatibility and cell uptake profile of 
      losartan-HA micelles were studied in murine fibroblast cells (NIH3T3), human 
      hepatic stellate cells (hHSC) and FL83B cells (hepatocyte cell line). The ability 
      of these nanoparticles to attenuate HSC activation was studied in activated HSC 
      cells based on alpha smooth muscle actin (α-sma) expression. Mice treated with 
      oral losartan or losartan-HA micelles were analyzed for serum enzyme levels 
      (ALT/AST, CK and LDH) and collagen deposition (hydroxyproline levels) in the 
      liver. The accumulation of HA micelles was observed in fibrotic livers, which 
      suggests increased delivery of losartan compared to normal livers and specific 
      uptake by HSC. Active reduction of α-sma was observed in hHSC and the liver 
      sections of losartan-HA micelle-treated mice. The serum enzyme levels and 
      collagen deposition of losartan-HA micelle-treated mice was reduced significantly 
      compared to the oral losartan group. Losartan-HA micelles demonstrated 
      significant attenuation of hepatic fibrosis via an HSC-targeting mechanism in our 
      in vitro and in vivo studies. These nanoparticles can be considered as an 
      alternative therapy for liver fibrosis.

AB  - Inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and disposition is common in both 
      preclinical and clinical researches. Losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 
      present a high degree of inter-individual differences in blood concentrations 
      that affect drug efficacy and side effect. Pharmacometabolomics has been 
      increasingly applied on predicting the drug responses by analyzing the 
      differences in metabolic profile. A pre-dose metabolic phenotype was investigated 
      to interpret inter-individual variations in the metabolism characteristics of 
      losartan. (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic 
      profiles were performed on 36 healthy Chinese male volunteers by measuring their 
      pre-dose plasma samples. After oral administration of losartan, the 
      concentrations of losartan and its bioactive metabolite EXP3174 were monitored by 
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Orthogonal partial least-squares 
      (O-PLS) model was conducted to select potential biomarkers that substantially 
      contributed to the inter-individual variations in the metabolism features via 
      analyzing the ratio of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of its metabolite to 
      parent drug. Potential metabolites such as glycine, phosphorylcholine, choline, 
      creatine, creatinine, lactate, citrate, α-glucose, and lipids showed strong 
      correlations with metabolism features of losartan. In addition, the pathway 
      analysis revealed that baseline lipid metabolism, the glycine, serine and 
      threonine pathway, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis metabolism pathway were 
      significantly associated with the ratio of PK parameters of EXP3174 to losartan. 
      Step-wise multiple linear regression (MLR) was constructed to investigate the 
      potential roles of the selected biomarkers in predicting individualized 
      metabolism characteristics of losartan. These results showed that the pre-dose 
      individual metabolic traits may be a useful approach for characterizing 
      individual differences in losartan metabolism characteristics and therefore for 
      expediting personalized dose-setting in further clinical studies.

TI  - Absorption and glucuronidation of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan 
      by the rat intestine.
PG  - 816-22
AB  - The absorption and metabolism by the rat intestine of the tetrazole-containing 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan were determined using in vitro, in 
      situ and in vivo models of absorption. The permeability coefficient of losartan 
      was similar at mucosal concentrations of 0.5 to 2 mM when assayed using segments 
      of jejunum in the Sweetana/Grass diffusion cell. The compound was conjugated 
      during transport to form a glucuronide at the N2-position of the tetrazole group; 
      the structure was confirmed by LC/MS/MS. Approximately 12% to 20% of losartan 
      transported across the duodenum and jejunum was conjugated to the glucuronide. 
      The glucuronide was not detected when sections of the ileum or colon were used. 
      In the in situ intestinal loop model, 18% to 23% of the losartan injected into 
      the lumen was recovered in the mesenteric vein by 1 hr. As in the in vitro model, 
      11% to 15% of the compound was conjugated on the tetrazole group during 
      absorption. EXP-3174, the pharmacologically active carboxylic acid metabolite of 
      losartan, was not detected in either the serosal buffer from the in vitro study 
      or the mesenteric plasma from the in situ intestinal loop. In conscious rats, 
      N2-glucuronide was detected in plasma samples from the portal vein soon after 
      oral administration of losartan. It was detected at low concentrations in only a 
      few of the arterial samples assayed. In conclusion, losartan is conjugated with 
      glucuronic acid at the N2-position of the tetrazole group during absorption by 
      the rat upper gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - More than 1 billion people worldwide suffer from hypertension; therefore, 
      hypertension management has been categorized as a global health priority. 
      Losartan potassium (LP) is an antihypertensive drug with a limited oral 
      bioavailability of about 33% since it undergoes the initial metabolic cycle. 
      Thus, nasal administration is a unique route to overcome first-pass metabolism. 
      The investigation focused on the potential effects of LP-loaded spanlastic 
      vesicles (SNVs) on LP pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic parameters, utilizing 
      a thin-film hydration methodology established on a 3(1)2(2) full factorial 
      design. Entrapment efficiency (EE%) ranged from 39.8 ± 3.87.8 to 83.8 ± 2.92% for 
      LP-SNVs. Vesicle size (VS) varied from 205.5 ± 6.5.10 to 445.1 ± 13.52 nm, and 
      the percentage of LP released after 8 h (Q(8h)) ranged from 30.8 ± 3.10 to 
      68.8 ± 1.45%. LP permeated through the nasal mucosa during 24 h and flocculated 
      from 194.1 ± 4.90 to 435.3 ± 13.53 µg/cm2. After twenty-four hours, the optimal 
      LP-SNVs in-situ gel showed 2.35 times more permeation through the nasal mucosa 
      than the LP solution. It also lowered systolic blood pressure, so it is thought 
      to be better than the reference formulation in terms of pharmacodynamics. The 
      pharmacokinetics studies demonstrated that the intranasal LP-SNVs gel boosted its 
      bioavailability approximately 6.36 times compared to the oral LP solution. Our 
      research showed that intranasal LP-SNVs could be a good nanoplatform because they 
      are well-tolerated and have possible pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

AB  - This study aims to obtain an inhalation powder with meaningful aerodynamic and 
      safety profiles for the lung delivery of losartan (LS). For this, the capacity of 
      self-assembly of chitosan (CS) and dextran sulfate (DS) to form CS/DS microplex 
      (MC), incorporating high payload of hydrophilic LS was harnessed. Dry powder 
      inhaler (LS-MC-DPI), prepared via spray drying of the best achieved LS-MC, was 
      proposed to impart precise engineered inhalation characteristics. Micrometric 
      robust CS/DS MC was revealed to offer the opportunity to heighten LS 
      encapsulation, accounting for ~75%. LS-MC-DPI was successfully developed with 
      high yield, flowability, respirable aerodynamic size and morphology which formed 
      swellable and mucoadhesive network, facilitating intra-pulmonary delivery. 
      Moreover, sustained release pattern, augmented deep lung deposition and safe 
      histological profile were realized. Overall, the newly developed LS-MC DPI shows 
      promises as an inhalation system. The aerodynamic performance and safety of 
      LS-MC-DPI verify its suitability for further in vivo lung therapeutics.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is related to dysfunctional 
      adipose tissue, but the actions of angiotensin II (AII) in adipocytes remains 
      unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of RAAS blockers and AII in 
      lipolysis and glycolysis from isolated adipocytes in Wistar (WIS), Wistar-Kyoto 
      (WKY) and Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR). Adipocytes from 15-weeks-old 
      WIS, WKY and SHR were incubated with AII (10(-17) M to 10(-6) M) and 
      noradrenaline (NOR - 10(-10) M to 10(-4) M) in presence or not of antagonists 
      (Losartan Potassium 10(-4) M, PD 123319 5.6 nM or co-incubation). Glycerol and 
      lactate production in WIS and WKY were not affected by the RAAS blockade. SHR 
      glycerol was attenuated by the blockers but lactate was not affected. NOR induced 
      increase in glycerol from 10(-7) M for all strains. Normotensive rats are not 
      affected by blockers but decreased lipolytic activity ins SHR. The SHR 
      hypolipodistrophy cannot be related to any disturbance in lipolytic or glycolytic 
      upstream pathways.

TI  - Randomized placebo-controlled study on the effects of losartan and carvedilol on 
      albuminuria in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The renoprotective effects of agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin 
      system in renal transplant recipients have been supposed but not finally proven. 
      To shed more light on this issue, we performed a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the influence of the AT-1 
      angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan, on the surrogate marker of kidney 
      injury, albuminuria, in patients after renal transplantation. The safety of this 
      therapy was also evaluated. METHODS: Fourteen of 16 patients (nine male, five 
      female), age 45.36 +/- 3.04 years, 65.5 +/- 10.0 months after kidney 
      transplantation, with hypertension and stable serum creatinine 123 +/- 4 
      micromol/L without proteinuria, completed the protocol. Each patient underwent 
      two 8-week treatment periods (one with losartan 50-100 mg and one with carvedilol 
      12.5-25 mg) in random order, allowing an 8-week placebo washout between 
      treatments. The target office trough blood pressure was below 130/85 mmHg. 
      RESULTS: The ambulatory blood pressure did not differ in the treatment periods. 
      Losartan significantly reduced albuminuria relative to placebo and carvedilol 
      (27.62+/-17.58 vs. 49.55 +/- 25.33 v. 44.77 +/- 21.9 mg/g creatinine; P < 0.01). 
      A significant but not clinically relevant decrease in hemoglobin level after 
      losartan was observed (losartan: 129 +/- 3.1 g/l, placebo: 134.2 +/- 3.2, 
      carvedilol: 137.1 +/- 3.7; P < 0.001). Serum potassium, creatinine, creatinine 
      clearance, and trough blood cyclosporine levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: 
      Losartan decreases microalbuminuria in renal transplant recipients with 
      clinically minimal side effects.

TI  - Clinical pharmacology of multiple-dose losartan, an angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 403-8
AB  - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations of multiple doses of 
      losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, were examined in nine patients 
      with essential hypertension. Participants were given placebo once daily for the 
      first 7 days (from day -7 to day -1), and then 50 mg of losartan for the next 9 
      days (from day 1 to day 9). The 24-hour blood pressure was measured on days -1, 
      1, and 7 and blood samples for measurement of losartan and its active metabolite, 
      E-3174, were obtained on days 1 and 7. Plasma concentrations of uric acid and 
      plasma clearance were determined before and during treatment with losartan, and 
      at the end of the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters after the seventh dose, 
      including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (tmax) of losartan 
      and E-3174, did not differ significantly from those after the first dose. The 
      blood pressure lowering effect of losartan, however, was significantly greater 
      after the seventh dose than after the first dose. Plasma uric acid decreased and 
      its plasma clearance (ClUA) increased significantly during repeated 
      administration with losartan. These values returned to pretreatment levels after 
      the end of treatment. These results suggest that although the pharmacokinetic 
      profiles of losartan and E-3174 do not change during repeated administration, the 
      blood pressure lowering effect in hypertensive patients is greater after multiple 
      doses than after a single dose.

TI  - Comparative bioavailability of two losartan formulations in healthy human 
      volunteers after a single dose administration.
PG  - 142-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the bioavailability of two potassic losartan immediate 
      release tablet (50 mg) formulations (Losartan from Laboratórios Cristália Ltd., 
      Brazil, as a test formulation and Cozaar from Merck Sharp & Dohme Farmacêutica 
      Ltd., Brazil, as a reference formulation) in 25 volunteers of both sexes. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in an open, randomized, 2-period 
      crossover design and a 1-week washout period. Plasma samples were obtained over a 
      24-hour interval. The concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite 
      losartan acid were analyzed by combined reversed phase liquid chromatography and 
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) with negative ion electrospray ionization 
      using a selected ion monitoring method. From the losartan and losartan acid 
      plasma concentrations vs. time curves the following pharmacokinetic parameters 
      were obtained: AUClast, AUC0-inf and Cmax. RESULTS: The geometric mean and 
      respective 90% confidence interval (CI) of Losartan/Cozaar losartan percent 
      ratios were 92.9% (82.2-105.0%) for Cmax, 99.0% (92.5-105.9%) for AUClast, and 
      99.1% (92.7-105.8%) for AUC0-inf. Furthermore, the geometric mean and respective 
      90% CI of Losartan/Cozaar losartan acid percent ratios were 98.5% (91.5-106.0%) 
      for Cmax, 97.9% (93.3 102.7%) for AUClast, and 98.1% (93.6-102.9%) for AUC0-inf. 
      CONCLUSION: Since the 90% CI for Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-inf were within the 
      80-125% interval proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration, it was 
      concluded that the potassic losartan immediate release 50 mg tablet was 
      bioequivalent to the Cozaar immediate release 50 mg tablet, according to both the 
      rate and extent of absorption. While there were no significant differences in the 
      bioequivalence assessed by either losartan or losartan acid, future 
      bioequivalence studies on losartan may be performed by quantifying losartan alone 
      as the parent compounds are more discriminative.

AB  - The discovery, in vitro and in vivo studies of the highly potent AT(1) antagonist 
      12a (BR-A-657, Fimasartan) antagonists are presented. A series of 
      pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives as losartan analogue were synthesized and 
      evaluated for a novel class of AT(1) receptor antagonists. Among them, 12a 
      containing thioamido moiety displayed both high in vitro functional antagonism 
      and binding affinity [IC(50)=0.42 and 0.13 nM, respectively] and inhibited 
      strongly in vivo AngII-induced pressor response in pithed rats with an ED(50) of 
      0.018 mg/kg. Moreover, in vivo evaluation in furosemide-treated rat and conscious 
      renal hypertensive rat models and the pharmacokinetic study showed that 12a is a 
      highly potent and orally active AT(1) selective antagonist having stronger in 
      vivo potency than losartan.

TI  - A review of the current evidence for the use of angiotensin-receptor blockers in 
      chronic heart failure.
PG  - 571-8
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a central role in the 
      management of heart failure, reflecting the contribution of the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to the pathophysiology of the condition. 
      Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) bind specifically to the angiotensin type 1 
      receptor and may offer further benefits compared with ACE inhibitors. 
      Candesartan, losartan and valsartan have all been evaluated in large clinical 
      outcome trials in heart failure. They display marked differences in 
      pharmacokinetics and receptor-binding properties that may contribute to observed 
      differences in outcome. ELITE II found no significant difference in outcome with 
      losartan as compared with captopril. In the Val-Heft trial, valsartan reduced 
      heart failure hospitalisations when added to conventional therapy including an 
      ACE inhibitor in most patients, but had no effect on mortality. The CHARM 
      programme showed that candesartan reduced morbidity and mortality in heart 
      failure with reduced systolic function, both when added to ACE inhibitor therapy 
      or when used as an alternative in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. 
      Moreover, the CHARM-preserved study suggested that candesartan is beneficial in 
      patients with heart failure and preserved left-ventricular systolic function. A 
      growing body of evidence show that ARBs are an important contribution to the 
      pharmaceutical management of patients with heart failure.

TI  - Candesartan: a new-generation angiotensin II AT1 receptor blocker: pharmacology, 
      antihypertensive efficacy, renal function, and renoprotection.
PG  - S248-54
AB  - Candesartan, which is the active compound formed during adsorption of candesartan 
      cilexetil, is one of the new generation of angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers. 
      Candesartan is an insurmountable blocker with a slow dissociation from the AT1 
      receptor, and it has been shown to effectively reduce BP in humans and in a 
      variety of genetic and experimental models of hypertension. Possible mechanisms 
      for a better effect in BP reduction compared with losartan may be the 
      insurmountable characteristics of binding or more pronounced renal effects, but 
      these need further evaluation. Candesartan has favorable effects on renal 
      function demonstrated in both humans and animals, and has also been shown to 
      protect the kidney in several models of renal injury. The beneficial effects 
      exerted by candesartan could even be demonstrated in experimental models of 
      hypertension in which BP is affected little, if at all. The renoprotective 
      effects have been observed in the regulation of gene expression, as well as in 
      biochemical and histologic evaluations.

AB  - Tumor tissue presents much denser and stiffer extracellular matrix (ECM), which 
      can hinder the penetration of most nanoparticles (NPs) and contribute to the 
      tumor cell proliferation. Here, NIR-activated losartan was encapsulated in hollow 
      mesoporous prussian blue nanoparticles (HMPBs) to degrade ECM. The results showed 
      that losartan enhanced the penetration of DOX, 1.47% of the injected dose (ID) of 
      DOX reached the tumor tissues, which was 3.00-fold higher than the control group 
      (0.49%). In addition, as the existence of thermo-sensitive lauric acid, 
      (Losartan + DOX)@HMPBs could achieve near "zero drug leakage" during blood 
      circulation, so as to reduce the damage of DOX to normal tissues. Furthermore, 
      the animal experiments proved tumor inhibition ability of (Losartan + DOX)@HMPBs 
      in synergistic of photothermal/chemotherapy, with the tumor growth inhibition 
      rate of 81.3%. Taken together, these findings can be a candidate for developing 
      vectors with enhanced tumor penetration and therapeutic effect in future clinical 
      application. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Due to the existence of denser 
      extracellular matrices (ECM), only 0.7% of the administered nanoparticles dose is 
      delivered to tumor, which will limit the tumors' therapeutic effect. Degradation 
      of ECM can improve the penetration of nanoparticles in tumors. However, no 
      researchers has encapsulated losartan in nanoparticles to degrade ECM. Herein, we 
      developed a NIR induced losartan and DOX co-delivery system based on hollow 
      mesoporous prussian blue nanoparticles (HMPBs) to degrade ECM and improve the 
      penetration of nanoparticles in tumors. The prepared nanoparticles can also 
      acheive near "zero drug leakage" during blood circulation and "fixed-point drug 
      release" in tumor, so as to reduce the damage of DOX to normal tissues. We 
      believe the prepared nanoparticles provide a new platform for cancer treatment.

AB  - In this case report we describe a 62-year-old man, intoxicated with losartan, an 
      angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. The patient presented with a systolic blood 
      pressure of 60 mmHg, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycaemia. His condition 
      worsened within the first hour of arrival despite infusion of four litres of 
      saline, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin as well as insulin and 
      antibiotics. Intravenous methylene blue 75 mg was infused over five minutes. 
      Within 30 minutes his systolic pressure increased to 100 mmHg, and the infusion 
      of epinephrine could be reduced four hours later.

TI  - A cytochrome P450 phenotyping cocktail causing unexpected adverse reactions in 
      female volunteers.
PG  - 1997-9
LID - 10.1007/s00228-013-1561-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A four-drug cytochrome P450 (CYP) phenotyping cocktail was developed 
      to rapidly and safely determine CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 enzyme 
      activity and phenotype. METHODS: The cocktail consisted of the single CYP 
      phenotyping probes of 50 mg tramadol (CYP2D6), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19), 25 mg 
      losartan (CYP2C9) and 200 mg caffeine (CYP1A2) and was administered as a single 
      oral dose. For enzyme activity measurements, urine was collected as 8 h 
      post-administration and blood was sampled at 4 h. The enzyme activity was 
      determined by metabolic ratios of molar concentrations of the drugs and their 
      enzyme catalyzed metabolites and was correlated to the relevant genotypes. 
      RESULTS: In a pilot study in 12 healthy male volunteers the CYP 
      genotype-phenotype correlation and robustness of the cocktail was successfully 
      determined without detection of any adverse drug reactions. In the subsequent 
      population study, four female volunteers experienced unexpected and unacceptable 
      moderate and severe adverse reactions (ARs) of headache, dizziness, nausea, 
      vomiting, blue fingers, nails and lips and difficulties in urinating, which led 
      to the study being prematurely terminated after inclusion of only 22 subjects (15 
      males, 7 females) [corrected]. CONCLUSION: Attention must be paid to adverse 
      reactions when designing new combinations of phenotype cocktails regardless of 
      the doses and drugs involved. We specifically warn against the combination of 
      tramadol, omeprazole, losartan and caffeine.

TI  - Fluconazole but not itraconazole decreases the metabolism of losartan to E-3174.
PG  - 445-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Losartan is metabolised to its active metabolite E-3174 by CYP2C9 and 
      CYP3A4 in vitro. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, whereas fluconazole 
      affects CYP2C9 more than CYP3A4. We wanted to study the possible interaction of 
      these antimycotics with losartan in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A randomised, 
      double-blind, three-phase crossover study design was used. Eleven healthy 
      volunteers ingested orally, once a day for 4 days, either itraconazole 200 mg, 
      fluconazole (400 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on days 2-4) or placebo (control). On day 
      4, a single 50-mg oral dose of losartan was ingested. Plasma concentrations of 
      losartan, E-3174, itraconazole, hydroxy-itraconazole and fluconazole were 
      determined over 24 h. The blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded over 
      24 h. RESULTS: The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve 
      [AUC(0-infinity)] of E-3174 were significantly decreased by fluconazole to 30% 
      and to 47% of their control values, respectively, and the t1/2 was increased to 
      167%. Fluconazole caused only a nonsignificant increase (23-41%) in the AUC and 
      t1/2 of the unchanged losartan. Itraconazole had no significant effect on the 
      pharmacokinetic variables of losartan or E-3174. The ratio 
      AUC(0-infinity)(E-3174)/AUC(0-infinity)losartan was 60% smaller during the 
      fluconazole than during the placebo and itraconazole phases. No clinically 
      significant changes in the effects of losartan on blood pressure and heart rate 
      were observed between fluconazole, itraconazole and placebo phases. CONCLUSION: 
      Fluconazole but not itraconazole interacts with losartan by inhibiting its 
      metabolism to the active metabolite E-3174. This implicates that, in man, CYP2C9 
      is a major enzyme for the formation of E-3174 from losartan. The clinical 
      significance of the fluconazole losartan interaction is unclear, but the 
      possibility of a decreased therapeutic effect of losartan should be kept in mind.

AB  - The bioavailability of a new losartan preparation 
      (2-butyl-4-chloro-1-[p-(o-1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]imidazole-5-methanol 
      monopotassium salt, CAS 114798-26-4) was compared with the reference preparation 
      of the drug in 24 healthy male volunteers, aged between 19 and 32. The open, 
      randomized, single-blind two-sequence, two-period crossover study design was 
      performed. Under fasting conditions, each subject received a single oral dose of 
      100 mg losartan as a test or reference formulation. The plasma concentrations of 
      losartan and its active metabolite were analyzed by a rapid and sensitive HPLC 
      method with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters included AUC0-36h, 
      AUC0-infinity, Cmax, t1/2, and Ke. Values of AUC0-infinity demonstrate nearly 
      identical bioavailability of losartan from the examined formulations. The 
      AUC0-infinity of losartan was 2019.92+/-1002.90 and 2028.58+/-837.45 ng x h/ml 
      for the test and reference formulation, respectively. The AUC0-infinity of the 
      metabolite was 10851.52+/-4438.66 and 11041.18 +/-5015.81 ng x h/ml for test and 
      reference formulation, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
      losartan was 745.94+/-419.75 ng/ml for the test and 745.74+/-329.99 ng/ml for the 
      reference product and the Cmax of the metabolite was 1805.77+/-765.39 and 1606.22 
      +/-977.22 ng/ml for the test and reference product, respectively. No statistical 
      differences were observed for Cmax and the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve for both losartan and its active metabolite. 90 % 
      confidence limits calculated for Cmax and AUC from zero to infinity 
      (AUC0-infinity) of losartan and its metabolite were included in the 
      bioequivalence range (0.8-1.25 for AUC). This study shows that the test 
      formulation is bioequivalent to the reference formulation for losartan and its 
      main active metabolite.

      Spectrometric Method for Fast Determination of Losartan in Rabbit Plasma.
PG  - 323-330
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmy114 [doi]
AB  - A rapid UPLC-MS-MS method was developed and validated for determination of 
      losartan in rabbit plasma. Protonated adducts of losartan and eprosartan (IS) 
      were monitored in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Molecular masses of daughter 
      species of losartan were m/z 423.19 > 207 and m/z 423.19 > 180; and of eprosartan 
      were m/z 425.11 > 135 and m/z 425.11 > 107. Losartan from plasma samples was 
      extracted by protein precipitation method. The mobile phase comprising water 
      (0.1% formic acid) (A) and acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) (B) was used in 
      gradient mode. Analytes were eluted on Acquity UPLC®BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm 
      column. Sample run time was 3.0 min. The validation parameters: accuracy, 
      precision and recovery were within recommended limits. Losartan as well as 
      internal standard remains stable in benchtop stability study as well as in 
      post-preparative stability study. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax (182.79 
      ± 23.80 ng/mL), Tmax (1.16 ± 0.28 h), AUC0-t (1188.57 ± 404.60 ng h/mL) and Kel 
      (0.0954 ± 0.0140 h-1) of losartan were measured. Method was successfully applied 
      for pharmacokinetic investigation in rabbits and can be used for losartan 
      determination in plasma sample obtained from other animals.

AB  - ASP8477 (molecular weight 325.36 g/mol) is a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor 
      intended for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Results from in vitro studies 
      indicated that ASP8477 is a direct inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, 2C9, 
      2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes at expected efficacious concentrations, with the 
      strongest effect on CYP2C19; a phase 1 study confirmed ASP8477 to be a CYP2C19 
      inhibitor. To further evaluate the interaction potential of ASP8477, a cocktail 
      interaction study was performed using the probe substrates of the validated Inje 
      cocktail containing losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan 
      (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4). Because ASP8477 shows nonlinear 
      pharmacokinetics, 3 doses (20, 60, and 100 mg) were evaluated. This study 
      revealed changes in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) of the 
      probe substrates after treatment with 20, 60, and 100 mg ASP8477, respectively, 
      compared with substrates alone with geometric mean ratios of: midazolam, 119%, 
      151%, and 158%; losartan, 107%, 144%, and 190%; omeprazole, 213%, 456%, and 610%; 
      and dextromethorphan, 138%, 340%, and 555% (with increasing doses, respectively). 
      Overall, ASP8477 was a weak inhibitor for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, a moderate to strong 
      inhibitor for CYP2C19, and a weak to strong inhibitor for CYP2D6, with doses from 
      20 to 100 mg. This study confirmed that the Inje cocktail approach was able to 
      detect relevant drug-drug interactions impacting further development of ASP8477 
      and future therapeutic use. With the approach used here, the inhibiting effect of 
      a perpetrator drug on different CYP enzymes can be evaluated, and at different 
      doses, thereby supporting dose recommendations for potential interactions.

PG  - 2231-2237
AB  - Controlled release formulations are administered once a day and reduce frequency 
      of dose and ensuring patient's compliance. In the current research controlled 
      release matrices of losartan potassium formulated with polymeric combinations of 
      ethocel grade 7 with carbopol 934P NF using different concentrations of polymers. 
      In some polymeric tablets, Co-excipients like CMC, Starch, HPMC was added by 
      replacing of 10% of filler in formulations at 10:5. Tablets were prepared by 
      direct compression method and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics. USP 
      Method-1 (rotating basket method) was used to carry out dissolution study in 
      phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Drug release kinetics determined and comparison of 
      dissolution patterns was done with reference tablets. The polymeric combinations 
      well retarded drug release and drug was released by anamolous non-fickian 
      diffusion mechanism. Dissolution profiles of tested tablets and reference tablets 
      were found not similar. Drug release rate was increased by co-excipients. It was 
      concluded from this research work that this polymeric combination can be used 
      efficiently in designing of controlled release martices.

TI  - Significance of angiotensin II receptor blocker lipophilicities and their 
      protective effect against vascular remodeling.
PG  - 593-600
AB  - Although the lipophilicities of the various angiotensin II receptor blockers 
      (ARBs) are very different, the relationship between lipophilicity and the 
      protective effect against vascular remodeling is unclear. In this study, we 
      compared the protective effects of a highly lipophilic ARB, telmisartan, and an 
      ARB with low lipophilicity, losartan, on vascular function and oxidative stress 
      in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP). SHR-SP received oral 
      placebo, 1 mg/kg telmisartan, or 10 mg/kg losartan for 2 weeks. The blood 
      pressure (BP) in SHR-SP was significantly higher than that in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) 
      rats before treatment, and the BP was reduced equally in telmisartan- and 
      losartan-treated SHR-SP compared to placebo-treated SHR-SP. Acetylcholine-induced 
      vasorelaxation in isolated carotid arteries was significantly weaker in SHR-SP 
      than in WKY rats, but in both telmisartan- and losartan-treated SHR-SP, 
      acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation was significantly higher than in 
      placebo-treated SHR-SP. Moreover, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in 
      telmisartan-treated rats was significantly stronger than in losartan-treated 
      SHR-SP. The expression of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene was 
      significantly higher in telmisartan- and losartan-treated rats than in 
      placebo-treated SHR-SP, and was significantly higher in telmisartan-treated rats 
      than in losartan-treated rats. In contrast, the expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase 
      subunit p22phox gene in telmisartan-treated SHR-SP was significantly lower than 
      that in losartan-treated SHR-SP. Immunohistochemistry showed that angiotensin II 
      expression in the aorta was significantly lower in telmisartan-treated SHR-SP 
      than in losartan-treated SHR-SP. In conclusion, a highly lipophilic ARB, 
      telmisartan, may be useful for preventing NAD(P)H oxidase activity, and thereby 
      for conferring vascular protection.

AB  - Pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions are caused by an induction or inhibition 
      of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or transporters e.g. P-glycoprotein. St. John's 
      wort extracts containing hyperforin increase the expression of CYP-enzymes and 
      P-glycoprotein mainly in the gut and liver which leads to a clinically relevant 
      decrease of the bioavailability of CYP and P-glycoprotein substrates. Contrarily, 
      the bioactivation of the prodrug losartan is reduced by milk thistle extracts 
      which is due to an inhibition of CYP2C9. However, the 15 % reduction of the 
      bioavailability of the active metabolite E-3174 is clinically not relevant. Also, 
      minor changes in drug bioavailability observed in clinical studies for valerian, 
      echinacea, ginkgo and hawthorne are clinically not relevant, although in vitro 
      studies point to drug interactions in vivo. Since for herbal extracts a positive 
      in vitro - in vivo correlation regarding the impact on drug bioavailability is 
      rare, results from in vitro studies should be carefully interpreted.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of nebivolol compared with other antihypertensive 
      drugs: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lowering BP to normal levels without quality of life 
      deterioration is the most important means of reducing cardiovascular risk. Recent 
      studies have challenged the position of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists 
      (beta-blockers) as first-line antihypertensive drugs. Nebivolol is a 
      third-generation, highly selective beta(1)-blocker that causes vasodilation 
      through nitric oxide (NO) release. This meta-analysis investigates the efficacy 
      and tolerability of nebivolol compared with other antihypertensive drugs and 
      placebo in patients with hypertension. METHODS: Twelve randomized controlled 
      studies were included in which nebivolol 5 mg once daily was compared with the 
      recommended clinical doses of other antihypertensive drugs (n = 9), placebo (n = 
      2), and both (n = 1). The clinical studies were selected after a MEDLINE search 
      up to 2007 using the key words 'nebivolol' and 'hypertension.' RESULTS: 
      Antihypertensive response rates (the percentage of patients achieving target BP 
      levels or a defined DBP reduction) were higher with nebivolol than with ACE 
      inhibitors (odds ratio [OR] 1.92; p = 0.001) and all antihypertensive drugs 
      combined (OR 1.41; p = 0.001) and similar to beta-blockers, calcium channel 
      antagonists (CCAs) and the angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARA) losartan. 
      Moreover, a higher percentage of patients receiving nebivolol achieved target BP 
      levels compared with patients treated with losartan (OR 1.98; p = 0.004), CCAs 
      (OR 1.44; p = 0.024), and all antihypertensive drugs combined (OR 1.35; p = 
      0.012). The percentage of patients experiencing adverse events did not differ 
      between nebivolol and placebo; adverse event rates were significantly lower with 
      nebivolol than losartan (OR 0.52; p = 0.016), other beta-blockers (OR 0.56; p = 
      0.007), nifedipine (OR 0.49; p < 0.001), and all antihypertensive drugs combined 
      (OR 0.59; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Results of previous pharmacokinetic studies 
      suggest that nebivolol 5 mg may not conform completely to the definition of a 
      classic beta-blocker demonstrating additional antihypertensive effect due to 
      endothelial NO release-mediated vasodilation. This meta-analysis showed that 
      nebivolol 5 mg achieved similar or better rates of treatment response and BP 
      normalization than other drug classes and other antihypertensive drugs combined, 
      with similar tolerability to placebo and significantly better tolerability than 
      losartan, CCAs, other beta-blockers, and all antihypertensive drugs combined. 
      Although not definitive, this meta-analysis suggests that nebivolol 5 mg is 
      likely to have advantages over existing antihypertensives and may have a role in 
      the first-line treatment of hypertension.

TI  - Proniosomal transdermal therapeutic system of losartan potassium: development and 
      pharmacokinetic evaluation.
PG  - 442-9
LID - 10.1080/10611860902963039 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to investigate the feasibility of 
      proniosomes as transdermal drug delivery system for losartan potassium. Different 
      preparations of proniosomes were fabricated using different nonionic surfactants, 
      such as Span 20, Span 40, Span 60, Span 80, Tween 20, Tween 40, and Tween 80. 
      Different formulae were prepared and coded as PNG-1 (proniosomal gel-1) to PNG-7. 
      The best in vitro skin permeation profile was obtained with proniosomal 
      formulation PNG-2 in 24 h. The permeability parameters such as flux, permeability 
      coefficient, and enhancement ratio were significant for PNG-2 compared with other 
      formulations (P < 0.05). This optimized PNG-2 was fabricated in the form of 
      transdermal patch using HPMC gel as a suitable base. Proniosomal transdermal 
      therapeutic system (PNP-H) was found to be the optimized one as it gave better 
      release of drug and better permeation in a steady-state manner over a desired 
      period of time, that is, 24 h through rat skin. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of 
      PNP-H showed a significant increase in bioavailability (1.93 times) compared with 
      oral formulation of losartan potassium. The formulation appeared to be stable 
      when stored at room temperature (30 +/- 2 degrees C) and at refrigeration 
      temperature (4 +/- 2 degrees C) for 45 days.

TI  - Paeoniae Radix, a traditional Chinese medicine, and CYP2C9 activity.
PG  - 229-30
AB  - Paeoniae Radix (PR) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine. A slight 
      effect of PR on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin that is mainly metabolised by 
      CYP2C9 has been reported. The aim of this pilot study was to clarify if PR has an 
      effect on losartan oxidation used as a measure of CYP2C9 activity. Three healthy 
      volunteers received a single oral dose of losartan before and after PR treatment. 
      Losartan and E-3174, an active metabolite of losartan, were analysed in 8 hour 
      urine. PR did not seem to have an effect on CYP2C9 activity when the 
      losartan/E-3174 ratios were compared before and after PR treatment (P = 0.56) 
      although a larger study would need to be undertaken to confirm this finding.

TI  - [Theoretical background of angiotensin II receptor blockade and its features in 
      clinical pharmacology].
PG  - 1763-8
AB  - The angiotensin (II) receptor (1) blockers are known first of all as 
      antihypertensive drugs, however, due to the role of the tissue renin-angiotensin 
      system (RAS) in different pathological conditions, their clinical importance 
      became more pronounced and are at present more widely used. The article gives an 
      overview of the recent knowledge in this field. Beside of summarizing 
      physiological and the most important pathophysiological aspects of the RAS, as 
      well as pharmacokinetic properties of the different angiotensin receptor blocker 
      drugs used at present in Hungary, the potential differences in blocking of the 
      converting enzyme and the angiotensin II receptors are also reviewed.

TI  - Impact of visceral leishmaniasis and curative chemotherapy on cytochrome P450 
      activity in Brazilian patients.
PG  - 1160-8
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12677 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of human 
      visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and curative chemotherapy on the activity of 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in patients from an endemic region 
      in Brazil. METHODS: Adult patients with parasitologically confirmed VL were given 
      a CYP phenotyping cocktail, comprising midazolam, omeprazole and losartan, 
      immediately before (Study phase 1), 2-3 days (phase 2) and 3-6 months (phase 3) 
      after curative VL chemotherapy. CYP activity was assessed by the apparent 
      clearance of midazolam (CYP3A), omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazol ratio in plasma 
      (CYP2C19) and losartan/E3174 ratio in urine (CYP2C9). RESULTS: Mean values (95% 
      confidence interval) in phases 1, 2 and 3 were, respectively: log apparent 
      midazolam clearance, 1.21 (1.10-1.31), 1.45 (1.32-1.57) and 1.35 
      (1.26-1.44) ml min(-1)  kg(-1) ; omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole ratio, 0.78 
      (0.61-0.94), 0.45 (0.27-0.63) and 0.37 (0.20-0.55); losartan/E3174 ratio, 0.66 
      (0.39-0.92), 0.35 (0.20-0.50) and 0.35 (0.16-0.53). Analysis of variance revealed 
      significant differences in CYP3A (P = 0.018) and CYP2C19 (P = 0.008), but not 
      CYP2C9 (P = 0.11) phenotypic activity, across the three study phases. CONCLUSION: 
      The phenotypic activities of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 were significantly reduced during 
      acute VL compared with post-chemotherapy. We propose that increased plasma 
      concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines during active disease account for the 
      suppression of CYP activity. The failure to detect significant changes in CYP2C9 
      activity in the overall cohort may reflect differential effects of the 
      inflammatory process on the expression of CYP isoforms, although the possibility 
      of insufficient statistical power cannot be dismissed.

TI  - Changes in Glycated Human Serum Albumin Binding Affinity for Losartan in the 
      Presence of Fatty Acids In Vitro Spectroscopic Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020401 [doi]
LID - 401
AB  - Conformational changes in human serum albumin due to numerous modifications that 
      affect its stability and biological activity should be constantly monitored, 
      especially in elderly patients and those suffering from chronic diseases (which 
      include diabetes, obesity, and hypertension). The main goal of this study was to 
      evaluate the effect of a mixture of fatty acids (FA) on the affinity of losartan 
      (LOS, an angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)) blocker used in hypertension, a 
      first-line treatment with coexisting diabetes) for glycated albumin-simulating 
      the state of diabetes in the body. Individual fatty acid mixtures corresponded to 
      the FA content in the physiological state and in various clinical states 
      proceeding with increased concentrations of saturated (FA(S)) and unsaturated 
      (FA(US)) acids. Based on fluorescence studies, we conclude that LOS interacts 
      with glycated human serum albumin (af)gHSA in the absence and in the presence of 
      fatty acids ((af)gHSA(phys), (af)gHSA(4S), (af)gHSA(8S), (af)gHSA(4US), and 
      (af)gHSA(8US)) and quenches the albumin fluorescence intensity via a static 
      quenching mechanism. LOS not only binds to its specific binding sites in albumins 
      but also non-specifically interacts with the hydrophobic fragments of its 
      surface. Incorrect contents of fatty acids in the body affect the drug 
      pharmacokinetics. A higher concentration of both FA(S) and FA(US) acids in 
      glycated albumin reduces the stability of the complex formed with losartan. The 
      systematic study of FA and albumin interactions using an experimental model 
      mimicking pathological conditions in the body may result in new tools for 
      personalized pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Insights into the Genetic Variations of Human Cytochrome P450 2C9: Structural 
      Analysis, Characterization and Comparison.
LID - 10.3390/ijms221910206 [doi]
LID - 10206
AB  - Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are one of the major xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes with 
      increasing importance in pharmacogenetics. The CYP2C9 enzyme is responsible for 
      the metabolism of a wide range of clinical drugs. More than sixty genetic 
      variations have been identified in CYP2C9 with many demonstrating reduced 
      activity compared to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. The CYP2C9*8 allele is 
      predominantly found in persons of African ancestry and results in altered 
      clearance of several drug substrates of CYP2C9. The X-ray crystal structure of 
      CYP2C9*8, which represents an amino acid variation from arginine to histidine at 
      position 150 (R150H), was solved in complex with losartan. The overall 
      conformation of the CYP2C9*8-losartan complex was similar to the previously 
      solved complex with wild type (WT) protein, but it differs in the occupancy of 
      losartan. One molecule of losartan was bound in the active site and another on 
      the surface in an identical orientation to that observed in the WT complex. 
      However, unlike the WT structure, the losartan in the access channel was not 
      observed in the *8 complex. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry studies 
      illustrated weaker binding of losartan to *8 compared to WT. Interestingly, the 
      CYP2C9*8 interaction with losartan was not as weak as the CYP2C9*3 variant, which 
      showed up to three-fold weaker average dissociation constant compared to the WT. 
      Taken together, the structural and solution characterization yields insights into 
      the similarities and differences of losartan binding to CYP2C9 variants and 
      provides a useful framework for probing the role of amino acid substitution and 
      substrate dependent activity.

TI  - Losartan: a selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist for the 
      treatment of heart failure.
PG  - 1897-914
AB  - Losartan (COZAAR) is the prototype of a new class of potent and selective 
      angiotensin II (AII) type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists with the largest 
      published preclinical and clinical data base. Since all of the AII antagonists 
      are selective for the AT(1) receptor, these drugs should exhibit similar 
      cardiovascular effects. However, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the AT(1) receptor 
      differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs 
      exist and will require investigation. Losartan (parent compound), has moderate 
      affinity for the AT(1) receptor (competitive inhibition). Losartan is 
      well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in 
      the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated E3174) with an affinity 
      20- to 30-times greater for the AT(1) receptor (non-competitive inhibition). 
      E3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes. 
      Antihypertensive and, in heart failure patients, haemodynamic activity is 
      observed over a 24 h period with once daily dosing. Over 6 million patients have 
      been treated for hypertension with continued excellent tolerability. Clinical 
      experience in heart failure is growing, and recent data suggest an improved 
      survival with losartan versus captopril, a drug from the 
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor class with proven benefit in this 
      population. The current comprehensive losartan clinical end-point programme (4 
      large scale morbidity/mortality trials) should provide evidence regarding the 
      efficacy of direct blockade of the AT(1) receptor with losartan compared to 
      standard therapy: 1) The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study - ELITE II, 2) The 
      Losartan Post-Myocardial Infarction Survival Study - OPTIMAAL, 3) The Losartan 
      Hypertension Survival Study - LIFE and 4) The Losartan Renal Protection Study - 
      RENAAL.

TI  - Unveiling the Thermodynamic Aspects of Drug-Cyclodextrin Interactions Through 
      Isothermal Titration Calorimetry.
PG  - 187-198
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-0920-0_15 [doi]
AB  - Due to their low toxicity and high aqueous solubility, cyclodextrins have emerged 
      as a distinctive class of supramolecules with wide application in the 
      pharmaceutical and food industry. Their ability to improve the water solubility, 
      stability and pharmacokinetic profile of small molecules has established them as 
      a rich toolkit for drug formulation. In order to improve the physicochemical 
      characteristics and the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug through cyclodextrin 
      inclusion, the proper cyclodextrin type has to be selected among the existing 
      great variety consisting of both natural and synthetic variants. The selection of 
      the most proper cyclodextrin variant comes after drug-cyclodextrin screening 
      studies targeting the characterization of the complex formation and evaluation of 
      the affinity and interaction forces participating in the complexation. Numerous 
      analytical, spectroscopic, separation and electrochemical techniques have been 
      applied to elucidate the interaction profile in a cyclodextrin-drug complex. 
      Herein, we describe the application of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) on 
      cyclodextrin-drug complexes that enables the charting of the binding affinity and 
      the thermodynamic profile of the inclusion complexes. We focus on the 
      experimental design and present technical tips of the ITC application. To better 
      illustrate the technique's rationale, the interaction between 
      2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and the antihypertensive drug losartan 
      is investigated.

TI  - Carboxylesterase 2 and Intestine Transporters Contribute to the Low 
      Bioavailability of Allisartan, a Prodrug of Exp3174 for Hypertension Treatment in 
      Humans.
PG  - 843-853
LID - 10.1124/dmd.118.085092 [doi]
AB  - Exp3174 is an active metabolite of losartan for the treatment of hypertension. 
      Allisartan (ALS3) is a marketed ester prodrug of Exp3174 to reduce 
      bioavailability variation of losartan in China. However, ALS3 exhibited a lower 
      oral absorption than losartan in humans. In this study, the enzymes and 
      transporters involved in ALS3 and Exp3174 disposition were investigated to 
      clarify the mechanisms. ALS3 underwent extensive hydrolysis to Exp3174 in S9 of 
      Caco-2 cells, human intestine microsomes (HIM), recombinant carboxylesterase 
      (rCES) 1, and rCES2. ALS3 exhibited similar affinity in HIM and rCES2 with K (m) 
      values of 6.92 and 6.77 μM, respectively, indicating that ALS3 is mainly 
      hydrolyzed to Exp3174 in human intestine by CES2. Transport assays of ALS3 and 
      Exp3174 suggested that ALS3 and Exp3174 are substrates of P-glycoprotein, breast 
      cancer resistance protein, and multidrug resistance protein 2 with poor 
      permeability. Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2B1 showed higher affinity 
      and clearance toward ALS3 (K (m) 0.75 μM and intrinsic clearance 215 μl/min/mg) 
      than those of Exp3174 (K (m) 7.85 μM and intrinsic clearance 16.1 μl/min/mg), 
      indicating that ALS3 is preferred to be uptaken into intestinal epithelia. 
      Hydrolysis of ALS3 was increased from approximately 30% to 55% in 
      CES2-transfected human embryonic kidney 293-OATP2B1 cells, indicating the 
      possible interplay between OATP2B1 and CES2. The influx and efflux of ALS3 across 
      Caco-2 cells increased the potential of ALS3 hydrolysis to Exp3174, and the 
      produced Exp3174 was rapidly pumped out, which led to undetectable ALS3 and 
      Exp3174 in basolateral (receiver) side in Caco-2 cells. Overall, our study 
      provided supportive evidences that the interplay between CES2 and transporters in 
      intestine contributes to the low bioavailability of ALS3 in humans.

AB  - Drug-drug interactions can lead to reduced efficacy of medical treatment. 
      Therapeutic failure may for instance result from combined treatment with an 
      inhibitor of the specific pathway that is responsible for the generation of 
      pharmacologically active drug metabolites. This problem may be overlooked in 
      clinical practice. Several examples of drugs will be discussed -clopidogrel, 
      losartan, tamoxifen and codeine - to illustrate differences in the potential 
      impact on drug treatment in clinical practice. We conclude that the combined use 
      of cytochrome P450-blocking serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tamoxifen or 
      codeine should be avoided, whereas the situation is much more complex regarding 
      the use of proton pump inhibitors together with clopidogrel, and the evidence 
      regarding cytochrome P450 inhibitor-dependent activation of losartan is 
      inconclusive.

AB  - Combination of metolazone (0.5 mg) and valsartan (80 mg) has been verified as a 
      promising therapy treatment for hypertension. In order to facilitate to 
      pharmacokinetic research, it needs a method for the simultaneously determination 
      of metolazone and valsartan in biological samples. However, there are no relative 
      reports so far. In order to facilitate to pharmacokinetic research, an on-line 
      solid phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of metolazone and 
      valsartan in beagle dog plasma was developed and validated in this study. An 
      on-line solid phase extraction column Retain PEP Javelin (10 mm × 2.1 mm) was 
      used to remove impurities in plasma samples. The metolazone, valsartan and 
      internal standard (losartan) were separated on a Poroshell 120 SB-C18 column 
      (4.6 mm × 50 mm × 2.7 µm) with a gradient elution procedure. Acidified 
      acetonitrile/water mixture was used as a mobile phase. The selected 
      multiple-reaction monitoring mode in positive ion was performed and the parent to 
      the product transitions m/z 366/259, m/z 436.2/291 and m/z 423.4/207 were used to 
      measure the metolazone, valsartan and losartan. The method was linear over the 
      range of 0.1-100 ng/mL and 1-1000 ng/mL for metolazone and valsartan, 
      respectively. This method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, 
      sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, and stability and then 
      successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies of the metolazone and valsartan 
      combination tablets in beagle dogs.

TI  - Transport-Metabolism Interplay of Atazanavir in Rat Hepatocytes.
PG  - 389-97
LID - 10.1124/dmd.115.068114 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms governing the intra- to 
      extracellular unbound concentration ratio (Kpu,u) for the HIV protease inhibitor 
      atazanavir (ATV) in rat hepatocytes. We had previously proposed a new method to 
      determine Kpu,u by using the unbound Km values from metabolism studies with 
      suspended rat hepatocytes and rat liver microsomes. Following that method, we 
      determined that the value of ATV Kpu,u was 0.32, indicating that ATV 
      hepatocellular clearance is uptake rate-limited. This hypothesis was supported by 
      the linear correlation between Kpu,u and active uptake clearance (P = 0.04; 
      R(2)=0.82) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the uptake transport 
      inhibitor losartan. Moreover, in contrast to an expected increase of Kpu,u upon 
      inhibition of ATV metabolism, a decrease of Kpu,u was observed, suggesting an 
      increased impact of sinusoidal efflux. In summary, involvement of active uptake 
      transport does not guarantee high intracellular accumulation; however, it has a 
      key role in regulating intracellular drug concentrations and drug metabolism. 
      These findings will help improve future in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolations and 
      likewise physiologically based pharmacokinetic models.

AB  - Low efficacy of cationic polymer-based formulations (polyplexes) for systemic 
      gene delivery to tumors remains the crucial concern for their clinical 
      translation. Here we show that modulating the physiological state of a tumor 
      using clinically approved pharmaceuticals can improve delivery of intravenously 
      injected polyplexes to murine melanoma tumors with different characteristics. 
      Direct comparison of drugs with different mechanisms of action has shown that 
      application of nitroglycerin or losartan improved extravasation and tumor uptake 
      of polyplex nanoparticles, whereas angiotensin II had almost no effect on 
      polyplex accumulation and microdistribution in the tumor tissue. Application of 
      nitroglycerin and losartan caused from 2- to 6-fold enhanced efficacy of 
      polyplex-mediated gene delivery depending on the tumor model. The results 
      obtained on polyplex behavior in tumor tissues depending on physiological state 
      of the tumor can be relevant to optimize delivery of polyplexes and other 
      nanomedicines with similar physicochemical properties.

PG  - 228-36
LID - 10.1002/bdd.1888 [doi]
AB  - A cocktail approach can detect the activities of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      isoforms following the administration of multiple CYP-specific substrates in a 
      single experiment. This study aimed to develop a simultaneous and comprehensive 
      in vivo analysis of CYP activity in rats. The rats received an oral 
      administration of losartan (10 mg/kg) and omeprazole (40 mg/kg). Caffeine (1 
      mg/kg), dextromethorphan (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg) were administered 15 
      min later. In the drug-interaction phase, the rats were treated orally with 
      dexamethasone (80 mg/kg) 24 h before, or with ketoconazole (10 mg/kg), 
      fluvoxamine (100 mg kg) or fluconazole (10 mg/kg) 1 h before the administration 
      of cocktail drugs. The concentrations of the drugs and their metabolites were 
      determined by LC/MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of five CYP substrates and their 
      metabolites were simultaneously evaluated after the oral drug administration. 
      Fluvoxamine and fluconazole significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of caffeine, 
      and the AUC of omeprazole and midazolam. Dexamethasone significantly increased 
      Cmax and AUC of losartan, while it decreased the Cmax of midazolam. Ketoconazole 
      showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the tested 
      drugs. In conclusion, a cocktail approach was developed for simultaneous and 
      comprehensive analysis of the activities of multiple CYP isoforms in rats. In 
      this approach, the effects of inhibitors and an inducer of various CYP isoforms 
      were examined. Although further studies are necessary to predict the effects in 
      humans, this approach may be expected to serve as a convenient method for 
      detecting drug-drug interactions in rats.

TI  - HPLC determination of irbesartan in human plasma: its application to 
      pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 568-72
LID - 10.1002/bmc.1154 [doi]
AB  - A simple and rapid HPLC method using fluorescence detection was developed for 
      determination of irbesartan in human plasma. Sample preparation was accomplished 
      through a simple deproteinization procedure with 0.4 mL of acetonitrile 
      containing 800 ng/mL of losartan (internal standard), and to a 0.1 mL plasma 
      sample. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Zorbax Xclipse XDB C18 
      column (150 x 4.6 mm, i.d., 5 microm) at 40 degrees C. An isocratic mobile phase, 
      acetonitrile:0.1% formic acid (37:63, v/v), was run at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL/min, 
      and the column eluent was monitored using a fluorescence detector set at 
      excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 and 370 nm, respectively. The 
      retention times of irbesartan and losartan were 4.4 and 5.9 min, respectively. 
      This assay was linear over a concentration range of 10-5000 ng/mL with a lower 
      limit of quantification of 10 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation for this assay 
      precision was less than 8.48%, and the accuracy exceeded 94.4%. The mean relative 
      recoveries of irbesartan and losartan were 98.4 and 99.1%, respectively. This 
      method was successfully applied for pharmacokinetic study after oral 
      administration of irbesartan (300 mg) to 23 Korean healthy male volunteers.

TI  - Clinical differences among angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - The six major classes of antihypertensive agents prescribed worldwide are similar 
      in efficacy but dissimilar in tolerability. Recently, the World Health 
      Organization-International Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) concluded that 
      agents from all six classes are suitable for the initiation and maintenance of 
      antihypertensive therapy, including the newest class of agents, the angiotensin 
      II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs). The ideal antihypertensive agent should be 
      effective and well tolerated, as well as synergistic in blood pressure-lowering 
      effects when combined with other agents. As monotherapy, AIIRAs have demonstrated 
      efficacy similar to other classes of antihypertensive agents in numerous clinical 
      trials. Several AIIRAs have also demonstrated enhanced efficacy when combined 
      with a low dose of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). A well-known feature 
      of this new class of agents is placebo-level tolerability; however, less is known 
      about intra-class differences. Losartan, the first approved AIIRA, has become an 
      important benchmark for within-class comparisons with respect to antihypertensive 
      efficacy. Head-to-head comparisons between losartan and newer AIIRAs have been 
      conducted; their cumulative results indicate that the antihypertensive effect and 
      antagonistic activity of losartan may be the weakest among AIIRAs. In a recent 
      clinical trial, we demonstrated that irbesartan produces statistically superior 
      blood pressure reduction when compared to valsartan. This may have clinical 
      implications for agent selection among the AIIRAs.

TI  - CYP2C9-mediated metabolic activation of losartan detected by a highly sensitive 
      cell-based screening assay.

AB  - Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a major problem in drug development, and reactive 
      metabolites generated by cytochrome P450s are suggested to be one of the causes. 
      CYP2C9 is one of the major enzymes in hepatic drug metabolism. In the present 
      study, we developed a highly sensitive cell-based screening system for 
      CYP2C9-mediated metabolic activation using an adenovirus vector expressing CYP2C9 
      (AdCYP2C9). Human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells infected with our constructed 
      AdCYP2C9 for 2 days at multiplicity of infection 10 showed significantly higher 
      diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase activity than human hepatocytes. AdCYP2C9-infected 
      cells were treated with several hepatotoxic drugs, resulting in a significant 
      increase in cytotoxicity by treatment with losartan, benzbromarone, and tienilic 
      acid. Metabolic activation of losartan by CYP2C9 has never been reported, 
      although the metabolic activations of benzbromarone and tienilic acid have been 
      reported. To identify the reactive metabolites of losartan, the semicarbazide 
      adducts of losartan were investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry. Two CYP2C9-specific semicarbazide adducts of losartan (S1 and S2) 
      were detected. S2 adduct formation suggested that a reactive metabolite was 
      produced from the aldehyde metabolite E3179, but a possible metabolite from S1 
      adduct formation was not produced via E3179. In conclusion, a highly sensitive 
      cell-based assay to evaluate CYP2C9-mediated metabolic activation was 
      established, and we found for the first time that CYP2C9 is involved in the 
      metabolic activation of losartan. This cell-based assay system would be useful 
      for evaluating drug-induced cytotoxicity caused by human CYP2C9.

TI  - Angiotensin receptor blockers for the reduction of proteinuria in diabetic 
      patients with overt nephropathy: results from the AMADEO study.
PG  - 129-40
AB  - Diabetic kidney disease is characterized by persistent albuminuria (>300 mg/dl or 
      >200 microg/min) that is confirmed on at least 2 occasions 3 to 6 months apart, 
      with a progressive decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), elevated 
      arterial blood pressure, and an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end stage renal 
      disease (ESRD) prompting investigators to evaluate mechanisms by which to slow 
      disease progression. One such mechanism is to block the activity of angiotensin 
      II at the receptor site and agents that follow this mechanism are referred to as 
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). There is sufficient clinical evidence to 
      support that ARB have protective effects on kidney function in patients with 
      diabetes and hypertension. However, in the past decade there have been few 
      investigations comparing individual ARBs on renal outcomes. Telmisartan, a 
      lipophilic ARB with a long half-life, has been hypothesized to have a greater 
      anti-proteinuric effect when compared to the shorter acting losartan. Therefore, 
      the A comparison of telMisartan versus losArtan in hypertensive type 2 DiabEtic 
      patients with Overt nephropathy (AMADEO) trial sought to investigate renal and 
      cardiovascular endpoints. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of 
      diabetic kidney disease and implications of the AMADEO trial in the context of 
      current understanding from recent outcome trials.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a losartan potassium released from a transdermal therapeutic

PG  - 679-82
AB  - Monolithic transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) were developed for sustained 
      antihypertensive effect of losartan potassium using the polymers Eudragit E 100 
      and polyvinyl pyrrolidone VA 64. The developed formulations (polymeric films) 
      were evaluated for physical characteristics, ex vivo (histopathology) and in vivo 
      (pharmacokinetic studies). Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as C(max), t(max), 
      and AUC were estimated. The transdermal formulation in the present study was 
      found to enhance the relative bioavailability of losartan potassium by 2.2 times 
      with reference to an oral delivery. The increased bioavailability might be due to 
      elimination of hepatic first pass metabolism. Thus, the transdermal formulation 
      F3E with polymeric composition of Eudragit E 100 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone VA 64 
      (5:3) was found to provide prolonged steady state concentrations of losartan 
      potassium with minimal fluctuations and improved bioavailability.

AB  - A decrease in the drug release rate over time typically affects the performance 
      of hydrophilic matrices for oral prolonged release. To address such an issue, a 
      Non-Uniform Drug Distribution Matrix (NUDDMat) based on hypromellose was proposed 
      and demonstrated to yield zero-order release. The system consisted of 5 overlaid 
      layers, applied by powder layering, having drug concentration decreasing from the 
      inside towards the outside of the matrix according to a descending staircase 
      function. In the present study, manufacturing and performance of the described 
      delivery platform were evaluated using drug tracers having different water 
      solubility. Lansoprazole, acetaminophen and losartan potassium were selected as 
      slightly (SST), moderately (MST) and highly (HST) soluble tracers. By halving the 
      thickness of the external layer, which contained no drug, linear release of HST 
      and MST was obtained. The release behavior of the NUDDMat system loaded with a 
      drug having pH-independent solubility was shown to be consistent in pH 1.2, 4.5 
      and 6.8 media. Based on these results, feasibility of the NUDDMat platform by 
      powder layering was demonstrated using drugs having different 
      physico-technological characteristics. Moreover, its ability to generate 
      zero-order release was proved in the case of drugs with water solubility in a 
      relatively wide range.

TI  - AT-1 receptor and phospholipase C are involved in angiotensin III modulation of 
      hypothalamic noradrenergic transmission.
PG  - 747-62
AB  - 1. We previously reported that angiotensin III modulates noradrenergic 
      neurotransmission in the hypothalamus of the rat. In the present work we studied 
      the effects of angiotensin III on norepinephrine release and tyrosine hydroxylase 
      activity. We also investigated the receptors and intracellular pathways involved 
      in angiotensin III modulation of noradrenergic transmission. 2. In rat 
      hypothalamic tissue labeled with [3H]norepinephrine 1, 10, and 100 nM and 1 
      microM losartan (AT1 receptor antagonist) had no effect on basal neuronal 
      norepinephrine release, whereas 10 and 100 nM and 1 microM losartan partially 
      diminished norepinephrine secretion evoked by 25 mM KCl. The AT2 receptor 
      antagonist PD 123319 showed no effect either on basal or evoked norepinephrine 
      release. The increase in both basal and evoked norepinephrine output induced by 1 
      microM angiotensin III was blocked by 1 microM losartan, but not by 1 microM PD 
      123319. 3. The phospholipase C inhibitor 5 microM neomicin inhibited the increase 
      in basal and evoked norepinephrine release produced by 1 microM angiotensin III. 
      4. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was increased by 1 microM angiotensin III and 
      this effect was blocked by 1 microM LST and 5 microM neomicin, but not by PD 
      123319. On the other hand, 1 microM angiotensin III enhanced phosphatidyl 
      inositol hydrolysis that was blocked by 1 microM losartan and 5 microM neomicin. 
      PD 123319 (1 microM) did not affect ANG III-induced phosphatidyl inositol 
      hydrolysis enhancement. 5. Our results confirm that angiotensin III acts as a 
      modulator of noradrenergic transmission at the hypothalamic level through the 
      AT1-phospholipase C pathway. This enhancement of hypothalamic noradrenergic 
      activity suggests that angiotensin III may act as a central modulator of several 
      biological processes regulated at this level by catecholamines, such as 
      cardiovascular, endocrine, and autonomic functions as well as water and saline 
      homeostasis.

TI  - Functional impact of CYP2C95, CYP2C96, CYP2C98, and CYP2C911 in vivo among black 
      Africans.
PG  - 113-8
AB  - Background and aim Previous data indicate that the urinary losartan/E-3174 ratio 
      is a marker for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 activity in vivo. The functional impact 
      of CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, and *11 polymorphisms in vivo has not been investigated 
      previously in humans. METHODS: A single oral dose of losartan (25 mg) was given 
      to 19 Beninese subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 (n = 9), *1/*5 (n = 1), *1/*6 (n = 1), 
      *1/*8 (n = 2), *1/*11 (n = 3), *5/*6 (n = 1), *5/*8 (n = 1), and *8/*11 (n = 1) 
      genotypes. Concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite E-3174 were 
      determined in urine from 0 to 8 hours by HPLC. The losartan/E-3174 metabolic 
      ratio was used as a measure of losartan oxidation in vivo. RESULTS: The urinary 
      losartan/E-3174 ratio in the various genotypes was as follows: 1.85 +/- 2.4 (mean 
      +/- SD) for CYP2C9*1/*1, 14.6 for CYP2C9*1/*5, 4.2 for CYP2C9*1/*6, 188 for 
      CYP2C9*5/*6, 11.6 for CYP2C9*5/*8, 0.44 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- SD) for CYP2C9*1/*8, 
      2.2 for CYP2C9*8/*11, and 5.72 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SD) for CYP2C9*1/*11. Compared 
      with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotypes, the losartan/E-3174 ratio was significantly 
      different in the CYP2C9*5 allele carriers (CYP2C9*1/*5, CYP2C9*5/*8, and 
      CYP2C9*5/*6 genotypes) (P =.01, Mann-Whitney) but was not different in 
      CYP2C9*1/*8 (P =.16) and CYP2C9*1/*11 (P =.11) carriers. The urinary 
      losartan/E-3174 ratio of the single CYP2C9*1/*6 subject was higher than the 95% 
      confidence interval of the mean of the CYP2C9*1/*1 group (0.0-3.7), whereas the 
      metabolic ratio of the CYP2C9*8/*11 carrier was inside the 95% confidence 
      interval of the means of the CYP2C9*1/*1 and CYP2C9*1/*11 groups (0.0-18). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The CYP2C9*5 and *6 alleles are associated with decreased enzyme 
      activity in vivo compared with the wild-type variant, whereas the CYP2C9*8 and 
      *11 variants did not appear to have large in vivo effects.

TI  - Evaluation of potential herbal-drug interactions of a standardized propolis 
      extract (EPP-AF®) using an in vivo cocktail approach.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Propolis has been employed extensively in many 
      cultures since ancient times as antiseptic, wound healing, anti-pyretic and 
      others due to its biological and pharmacological properties, such as 
      immunomodulatory, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, 
      antiviral, antifungal, antiparasite activities. But despite its broad and 
      traditional use, there is little knowledge about its potential interaction with 
      prescription drugs. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main objective of this work was to 
      study the potential herbal-drug interactions (HDIs) of EPP-AF® using an in vivo 
      assay with a cocktail approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subtherapeutic doses of 
      caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, metoprolol, midazolam and fexofenadine were used. 
      Sixteen healthy adult volunteers were investigated before and after exposure to 
      orally administered 125 mg/8 h (375 mg/day) EPP-AF® for 15 days. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were calculated based on plasma concentration versus time (AUC) 
      curves. RESULTS: After exposure to EPP-AF®, it was observed decrease in the 
      AUC(0-∞) of fexofenadine, caffeine and losartan of approximately 18% 
      (62.20 × 51.00 h.ng/mL), 8% (1085 × 999 h.ng/mL) and 13% (9.01 × 7.86 h.ng/mL), 
      respectively, with all 90% CIs within the equivalence range of 0.80-1.25. On the 
      other hand, omeprazole and midazolam exhibited an increase in AUC(0-∞) of, 
      respectively, approximately 18% (18.90 × 22.30 h.ng/mL) and 14% 
      (1.25 × 1.43 h.ng/mL), with the upper bounds of 90% CIs slightly above 1.25. 
      Changes in pharmacokinetics of metoprolol or its metabolite α-hydroxymetoprolol 
      were not statistically significant and their 90% CIs were within the equivalence 
      range of 0.80-1.25. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study shows that EPP-AF® does 
      not clinically change CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A activities, once, 
      despite statistical significant, the magnitude of the changes in AUC values after 
      EPP-AF® were all below 20% and therefore may be considered safe regarding 
      potential interactions involving these enzymes. Besides, to the best of our 
      knowledge this is the first study to assess potential HDIs with propolis.

AB  - Variability of blood pressure responses to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin 
      system is influenced by factors inherent in the patient, such as renin status, 
      and by drug-specific factors, such as pharmacokinetics. The 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions of two doses of candesartan 
      cilexetil, which is an ester prodrug of the insurmountable angiotensin II type 1 
      (AT 1 ) receptor blocker candesartan, were compared with those of the standard 
      dose of losartan in normotensive volunteers whose renin status was controlled by 
      mild sodium depletion. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, the 
      effects of single oral doses of candesartan cilexetil, 8 mg and 16 mg, and 
      losartan, 50 mg, were compared for 24 h in 16 healthy individuals pretreated with 
      a single 40-mg dose of furosemide. Mean blood pressure was recorded by repeated 
      measurements using the oscillometric method. In addition, measurements were made 
      of plasma active renin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma levels of 
      candesartan and EXP-3174, the active metabolites of candesartan cilexetil and 
      losartan, respectively, were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography 
      and correlated to pharmacodynamic changes. The large interindividual variability 
      of EXP-3174 levels in subjects who received losartan revealed a significant 
      correlation between active renin and peak drug levels ( r = 0.77, n = 16, p < 
      0.01). Such a correlation was not found within either group of individuals who 
      received candesartan cilexetil, because of lower interindividual pharmacokinetic 
      variability. A dose-response relationship was found between plasma renin and 
      candesartan when both doses of candesartan cilexetil were analysed. The 
      pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral dose of candesartan cilexetil, 16 mg, 
      were superior to those of candesartan cilexetil, 8 mg, and losartan, 50 mg (see 
      Table). This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of a parallel-group, 
      dose-determination study performed in hypertensive patients. The less variable 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction for candesartan cilexetil than for 
      losartan could account for the smooth 24-h reduction in blood-pressure found in 
      patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. These results suggest not only that 
      AT 1 -receptor antagonists can be differentiated, but that they will not be 
      equally useful in clinical practice where, in contrast to clinical research, 
      clear evidence is more difficult to obtain because of variability in renin 
      status.

AB  - An oral buccoadhesive drug delivery system for Losartan potassium using a 
      hydrophilic polysaccharide, isolated from Prunus amygdalaus (Badam gum), was 
      developed and evaluated for its potential to overcome the drawbacks associated

      isolated polysaccharide has good physicochemical and morphological 
      characteristics and is suitable for use as a mucoadhesive sustain release polymer 
      in pharmaceutical dosage forms, to alleviate the drawbacks of the conventional 
      drug therapy of Losartan potassium.

AB  - The multifactorial etiology of hypertension has promoted the research of blood 
      pressure-lowering agents with multitarget actions to achieve better clinical 
      outcomes. We describe here the discovery of novel dual-acting antihypertensive 
      codrugs combining pharmacophores with angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor 
      antagonism and neprilysin (NEP) inhibition. Specifically, the codrugs combine the 
      AT1 antagonists losartan or its carboxylic acid active metabolite (E-3174) with 
      selected monocarboxylic acid NEP inhibitors through a cleavable linker. The 
      resulting codrugs exhibited high rates of in vitro conversion into the active 
      molecules upon incubation with human/rat liver S9 fractions and in vivo 
      conversion after oral administration in rodents. Moreover, the acute effects of 
      one of the designed codrugs (3b) was confirmed at the doses of 10, 30 and 60 
      mg/kg p.o. in the spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) model, showing better 
      antihypertensive response over 24 hours than the administration of an equivalent 
      fixed-dose combination of 15 mg/kg of losartan and 14 mg/kg of the same NEP 
      inhibitor used in 3b. The results demonstrate that the codrug approach is a 
      plausible strategy to develop a single molecular entity with combined AT1 and NEP 
      activities, aiming at achieving improved pharmacokinetics, efficacy and dosage 
      convenience, as well as reduced drug-drug interaction for hypertension patients. 
      In addition, the developability of the codrug should be comparable to the one of 
      marketed AT1 antagonists, most of them prodrugs, but bearing only the AT1 
      pharmacophore.

AB  - The aim of the present research work was to develop release modulated beads of 
      losartan potassium complexed with anion exchange resin, Duolite AP143 
      (cholestyramine). Chitosan was selected as a hydrophilic polymer for the 
      formation of beads which could sustain the release of the drug up to 12 h, along 
      with drug resin complex (DRC). Chitosan beads were prepared using an in-liquid 
      curing method by ionotropic cross-linking or interpolymer linkage with sodium 
      tripolyphosphate (TPP). The formulation of the beads was optimized for entrapment 
      efficiency and drug release using 3(2) full factorial design. The independent 
      variables selected were DRC/chitosan and percent of TPP. The optimization model 
      was validated for its performance characteristics. Studies revealed that as the 
      concentration of chitosan and TPP was increased, entrapment efficiency and the 
      drug release were found to increase and decrease, respectively. The swelling 
      capacity of chitosan-TPP beads decreased with increasing concentration of TPP. 
      The effect of chitosan concentration and percentage of TPP solution used for 
      cross-linking on entrapment efficiency and drug release rate was extensively 
      investigated. Optimized beads were subjected to in vivo studies in Wistar albino 
      rats to determine the mean arterial blood pressure and compared with marketed 
      formulation. The pharmacodynamic study demonstrates steady blood pressure control 
      for optimized formulation as compared to fluctuated blood pressure for the 
      marketed formulation.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Telmisartan (Tel) 
      and Losartan (Los) on nanoparticle intratumoral distribution and anticancer 
      effects in lung cancer. A549 lung tumor cells were orthotopically and 
      metastatically administered to Nu/nu mice. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles 
      (FPNPs, size ~200 nm) beads were used to study their intratumoral distribution 
      after Tel and Los treatments. Animals were administered with FPNPs and after 2h, 
      FPNPs intratumoral distribution was studied by fluorescent microscopy. Tel (~1.12 
      mg/kg) and Los (~4.5mg/kg) were administered by inhalation delivery at 
      alternative days for 4 weeks to tumor bearing animals. Collagen-1, transforming 
      growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), cleaved caspase-3, Vimentin and E-Cadherin 
      expressions were studied by western blotting. To correlate the AT1 receptor 
      blockage to anticancer effects, VEGF levels and microvessel densities (MVD) were 
      quantified. Los and Tel treated group resulted in the 5.33 and 14.33 fold 
      increase respectively in the FPNPs intratumoral distribution as compared to the 
      controls. Tel treatment attenuated 2.23 and 1.70 fold Collagen 1 expression 
      compared to untreated control and Los groups, respectively. Further, in Tel and 
      Los treated groups, the TGF-β1 active levels were significantly (p<0.05) 
      decreased. Tel (at four times less dose) was 1.89 and 1.92 fold superior in 
      anticancer activity to Los respectively in A549 orthotopic and metastatic tumor 
      models (p<0.05) when given by inhalation route. Tel, by virtue of its dual 
      pharmacophoric nature could be an ideal candidate for combination therapy to 
      improve the nanoparticle intratumoral distribution and anticancer effects.

TI  - Impact of body weight, low energy diet and gastric bypass on drug 
      bioavailability, cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic biomarkers: protocol 
      for an open, non-randomised, three-armed single centre study (COCKTAIL).
PG  - e021878

LID - e021878
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) is associated with changes in 
      cardiometabolic risk factors and bioavailability of drugs, but whether these 
      changes are induced by calorie restriction, the weight loss or surgery per se, 
      remains uncertain. The COCKTAIL study was designed to disentangle the short-term 
      (6 weeks) metabolic and pharmacokinetic effects of GBP and a very low energy diet 
      (VLED) by inducing a similar weight loss in the two groups. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      This open, non-randomised, three-armed, single-centre study is performed at a 
      tertiary care centre in Norway. It aims to compare the short-term (6 weeks) and 
      long-term (2 years) effects of GBP and VLED on, first, bioavailability and 
      pharmacokinetics (24 hours) of probe drugs and biomarkers and, second, their 
      effects on metabolism, cardiometabolic risk factors and biomarkers. The primary 
      outcomes will be measured as changes in: (1) all six probe drugs by absolute 
      bioavailability area under the curve (AUC(oral)/AUC(iv)) of midazolam (CYP3A4 
      probe), systemic exposure (AUC(oral)) of digoxin and rosuvastatin and 
      drug:metabolite ratios for omeprazole, losartan and caffeine, levels of 
      endogenous CYP3A biomarkers and genotypic variation, changes in the expression 
      and activity data of the drug-metabolising, drug transport and drug regulatory 
      proteins in biopsies from various organs and (2) body composition, 
      cardiometabolic risk factors and metabolic biomarkers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      The COCKTAIL protocol was reviewed and approved by the Regional Committee for 
      Medical and Health Research Ethics (Ref: 2013/2379/REK sørøst A). The results

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sailuotong (SLT) is a standard Chinese preparation made from extracts 
      of Panax ginseng (ginseng), Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo), and Crocus sativus (saffron). 
      Preliminary clinical trials and animal experiments have demonstrated that SLT 
      could improve cognition of vascular dementia (VD). PURPOSE: To avoid incident 
      drug-drug interaction which is easily encountered in patients of VD, the 
      potential influence of SLT on main drug-metabolic cytochromes P450 enzymes 
      (CYP450) was investigated. METHOD: A "cocktail probes" approach was employed to 
      evaluate the activities of CYP450. A rapid and selective analysis method was 
      developed to examine 5 CYP probe drugs and their specific metabolites in plasma 
      by using online SPE followed by a single LC-MS/MS run. After pretreatment for 2 
      weeks with SLT, ginseng, gingko, saffron or water (control), a cocktail solution 
      containing caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and midazolam was 
      given to rats orally. The plasma was obtained at different time intervals and 
      then measured for the concentration of probes and their metabolites using 
      developed SPE-LC-MS/MS method. Activity of five isozymes was estimated by 
      comparing plasma pharmacokinetics of substrates and their metabolites 
      (caffeine/paraxanthine for CYP1A2, losartan/E-3174 for CYP2C11, 
      omeprazole/5-hydroxyl omeprazole for CYP2C6, dextromethorphan/dextrophan for 
      CYP2D2 and midazolam/1-hydroxyl midazolam for CYP3A1/2) between control and drug 
      treatment groups. RESULT: Compared with control group, repeated administration of 
      SLT induced CYP1A2 by enhancing AUC (paraxanthine) / AUC (caffeine) to144%. The 
      influence is attributed to its herbal component of ginseng to a large extent. 
      Meanwhile, metabolic ability towards losartan was significantly elevated in SLT 
      and gingko group by 31% and 25% respectively, indicating weak induction of 
      CYP2C11 in rats. The analysis on probes of omeprazole and dextromethorphan showed 
      a lack of influence on CYP 2C6 and CYP2D2 in all treated groups. In terms of 
      CYP3A1/2, SLT decreased AUC ratio of 1-hydroxyl midazolam to midazolam by 39% and 
      extended the half-life of midazolam apparently. Besides, significantly decreased 
      systematic exposure of midazolam suggested the inhibition on metabolism of 
      CYP3A1/2 is likely secondary to the interaction on absorption at intestinal 
      level. The inhibition of SLT on CYP3A was likely attributed to ginseng and gingko 
      cooperatively. CONCLUSION: Further observation on herb-drug interaction should be 
      considered during clinical application of SLT.

TI  - [Candesartan - a novel AT(1)-angiotensin receptor blocker: peculiarities of 
      pharmacology and experience of use in arterial hypertension].
PG  - 55-65
AB  - Candesartan is a novel high-affinity type 1 AT(1)-receptor blocker characterized 
      by prolonged binding to and slow dissociation from the receptor. Pharmacokinetic 
      properties of candesartan explain its pronounced and lengthy (24-36 hours) 
      antihypertensive action which does not depend on patients sex, age and body mass. 
      Long term use of candesartan has been associated with regression of left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, renoprotective effect and lowered risk of stroke. 
      Candesartan is well tolerated. All these features make the drug suitable for wide 
      application in the management of hypertension. Preliminary results suggest that 
      candesartan can be useful in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - How well have animal studies with losartan predicted responses in humans?
PG  - S63-7
AB  - AIM: To compare the biological activity of losartan as seen in several animal 
      studies with results from similar clinical studies in hypertensive patients or 
      normal volunteers. RESULTS: With regard to oral bioavailability and estimates of 
      oral angiotensin II blocking activity, the animal models were reasonably good 
      predictors of the human response. Although formation of the major losartan 
      metabolite E 3174 differs according to species, both animal and human studies 
      suggest an association between plasma drug levels and angiotensin II blockade. 
      The finding that losartan demonstrated increased sensitivity during salt 
      depletion in animals was confirmed in humans. Possible beneficial effects on 
      renal function await further detailed clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Losartan has 
      been shown to lower blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. 
      However, cross-species comparisons are difficult because, unlike humans, animal 
      models of hypertension follow clearly defined hypertensive mechanisms. Differing 
      profiles of E 3174 metabolite formation also make cross-species comparisons 
      difficult.

TI  - Enhanced Tumor Targeting of Radiolabeled Mouse/Human Chimeric Anti-Tn Antibody in 
      Losartan-Treated Mice Bearing Tn-Expressing Lung Tumors.
PG  - 337-348
LID - 10.1089/cbr.2023.0138 [doi]
AB  - Aim: ChiTn, a mouse/human chimeric anti-Tn monoclonal antibody, was radiolabeled 
      with iodine-131 ((131)I) and technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) to assess its 
      biodistribution and internalization in Tn-expressing (Tn+) and wild-type (Tn-) 
      LL/2 lung cancer cells. Results: Selective accumulation and gradual 
      internalization of ChiTn were observed in Tn+ cells. Biodistribution in mice with 
      both Tn+ or Tn- lung tumors indicated that the uptake of radiolabeled ChiTn 
      within tumors increased over time. Dual-labeling experiments with (99m)Tc and 
      (131)I showed different biodistribution patterns, with (99m)Tc exhibiting higher 
      values in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, while (131)I showed higher uptake in 
      the thyroid and stomach. However, tumor uptake did not significantly differ 
      between Tn+ and Tn- tumors. To improve tumor targeting, Losartan, an 
      antihypertensive drug known to enhance tumor perfusion and drug delivery, was 
      investigated. Biodistribution studies in Losartan-treated mice revealed 
      significantly higher radiolabeled ChiTn uptake in Tn+ tumors. No significant 
      changes were observed in the uptake of the control molecule IgG-HYNIC™(99m)Tc. 
      Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the enhanced tumor targeting of 
      radiolabeled ChiTn in Losartan-treated mice with Tn-expressing lung tumors. They 
      highlight the potential of ChiTn as a theranostic agent for cancer treatment and 
      emphasize the importance of Losartan as an adjunctive treatment to improve tumor 
      perfusion and drug delivery.

TI  - Investigating the Impact of Gastric Emptying on Pharmacokinetic Parameters Using 
      Delay Differential Equations and Principal Component Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Losartan presents multiple peaks after single oral 
      administration, which can be attributed to gastric emptying. The aim of this 
      study was to describe the multiple peak phenomenon of losartan using a delay 
      differential model and a model with sine function. The impact of gastric emptying 
      on pharmacokinetic parameters was investigated by applying principal component 
      analysis to the individual parameter estimates. METHODS: Using Monolix(TM), two 
      population pharmacokinetic models were developed to describe the multiple peak 
      phenomenon; the first using delay differential equations and the second using a 
      sine function. Matlab(®) delay differential equation solver was used to 
      arithmetically solve both functions. Principal component analysis and all 
      statistical analyses were performed in the R language. RESULTS: The description 
      of losartan multiple peaks can be achieved by the use of either delay 
      differential equations or typical sine wave functions. Principal component 
      analysis unveiled the impact of gastric emptying on the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters. In the case of the delay differential equation model, a negative 
      relationship was found between the constant delay tau1 and the parameters 
      reflecting rate and extent of absorption (i.e., area under the curve [AUC], peak 
      plasma concentration [C(max)], and the absorption rate constant). Similar results 
      were obtained from the sine model, where a higher amplitude and lower period 
      (i.e., higher frequency) of gastric emptying were associated with higher AUC and 
      C(max) values. CONCLUSIONS: The observed multiple peaks for certain drugs like 
      losartan can be attributed to gastric emptying. Parameters describing gastric 
      emptying can be associated with pharmacokinetic metrics like AUC and C(max).

TI  - Transdermal Delivery of AT1 Receptor Antagonists Reduce Blood Pressure and Reveal 
      a Vasodilatory Effect on Kidney Blood Vessels.
PG  - 226-236

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) is pharmacologically targeted to 
      reduce blood pressure, and patient compliance to oral medications is a clinical 
      issue. The mechanisms of action of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in 
      reducing blood pressure are not well understood and are purported to be via a 
      reduction of angiotensin II signaling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a 
      transdermal delivery method for ARBs (losartan potassium and valsartan) and to 
      determine if ARBs reveal a vasodilatory effect of the novel RAS peptide, 
      alamandine. In addition, we determined the anti-hypertensive effects of the 
      transdermal delivery patch. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo experiments were 
      performed to develop an appropriate therapeutic system, promising an alternative 
      and more effective therapy in the treatment of hypertension. A variety of 
      penetration enhancers were selected such as isopropyl myristate, propylene 
      glycol, transcutol and dimenthyl sulfoxide to obtain a constant release of drugs 
      through human skin. Small resistance vessels (kidney interlobar arteries) were 
      mounted in organ baths and incubated with an ARB. Vasodilatory curves to 
      alamandine were constructed. RESULTS: The in vivo studies demonstrate that 
      systemic absorption of valsartan and losartan potassium using the appropriate 
      formulations provide a steady state release and anti-hypertensive effect even 
      after 24 hours of transdermal administration. No apparent skin irritations 
      (erythema, edema) were observed with the tested formulations. We also show that 
      blocking the AT1 receptor of rabbit interlobar arteries in vitro reveals a 
      vasodilatory effect of alamandine. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the potential 
      mechanism of AT1 receptor blockade via alamandine, and is an important 
      contribution in developing a favorable, convenient and painless antihypertensive 
      therapy of prolonged duration through transdermal delivery of AT1 blockers.

AB  - PURPOSE: In vivo phenotyping of CYP isoforms involved in the metabolism of 
      anti-HIV and antitubercular drugs is important to determine therapeutic dose 
      levels in HIV/AIDS-TB coinfections. In this study, we used a cocktail of 
      bupropion, losartan and dapsone for in vivo phenotyping of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and 
      N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) in plasma. CYP2B6 is the main catalyst of anti-HIV 
      efavirenz, while NAT2 is involved in antitubercular drug isoniazid metabolism. 
      CYP2C9 has a significant association with antitubercular drug-induced reactions. 
      The activity level of these isoforms has a significant bearing on therapeutic 
      dose in rapid and poor metabolizers. METHODS: Briefly, a cocktail of probe drugs 
      was administered to human volunteers and the drugs and metabolites were 
      determined by an inhouse LC-MS/MS method in 250 μl plasma. The mobile phase and 
      drug/metabolite extraction methods were optimized before analysis. Retention 
      time, Cmax and tmax were calculated from the same sample and the values were used 
      for phenotyping the isoforms. RESULTS: Retention time of drugs and metabolites 
      was calculated. The method was sensitive (4.5-8.2 %CV) and no interfering peak 
      was observed in any batch. %Accuracy of the calibrator and QC was 85-115%. %CV of 
      storage stability testing was within FDA approved limits. Cmax and tmax were 
      comparable to the values reported for individual drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      advocates the use of a cocktail of bupropion, losartan and dapsone for in vivo 
      phenotyping of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and NAT2, which is important in determining 
      therapeutic dose levels of anti-HIV and anti-TB drugs in HIV/AIDS-TB 
      coinfections.

AB  - The study was conducted in order to assess the bioequivalence of two film-coated 
      formulations containing 100 mg of losartan (CAS 124750-99-8) and 12.5 mg of 
      hydrochlorothiazide (CAS 58-93-5). Seventy-three healthy subjects were enrolled 
      in a randomised, single-dose, open-label, two-way crossover study, with a minimum 
      washout period of 7 days. A total of 21 blood samples were collected up to 36 h 
      post-dosing. Losartan, losartan carboxy acid and hydrochlorothiazide levels were 
      determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass detection (lower limit of 
      quantification: 1.01 ng/mL for hydrochlorothiazide, 2.02 ng/mL for losartan and 
      2.51 ng/mL for losartan carboxy acid). Pharmacokinetic parameters used for 
      bioequivalence assessment (AUC(0-t) and Cmax as primary and AUC(0-inf) as 
      secondary pharmacokinetic parameters) were determined from the losartan and 
      hydrochlorothiazide concentration data using non-compartmental analysis. Data 
      from losartan carboxy acid was reported and presented as supportive data. The 90% 
      confidence intervals (obtained by ANOVA) for losartan were 97.05-118.48% for Cmax 
      100.76-106.10% for AUC(0-t) and 100.80-106.10% for AUC(0-inf) whereas for 
      hydrochlorothiazide the 90% confidence intervals obtained were 103.94-115.33% for 
      Cmax, 101.97-109.61% for AUC(0-t) and 101.77-109.02% for AUC(0-inf), and for 
      losartan carboxy acid the intervals obtained were 98.31-107.82% for Cmax, 
      97.89-104.30% for AUC(0-t) and 98.06-104.30% for AUC(0-inf). All the 90% 
      confidence intervals obtained for all the parameters assessed were within the 
      predefined ranges (80-125%). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the 
      evaluated formulations are bioequivalent in terms of rate and extent of 
      absorption.

TI  - Converting enzyme determines plasma clearance of angiotensin-(1-7).
PG  - 496-502
AB  - We determined the mechanism accounting for the removal and metabolism of 
      angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in 21 anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive 
      (SHR), 18 age-matched normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD), and 36 mRen-2 transgenic 
      (TG+) rats. Animals of all 3 strains were provided with tap water or tap water 
      containing losartan, lisinopril, or a combination of lisinopril and losartan for 
      2 weeks. On the day of the experiment, Ang-(1-7) was infused for a period of 15 
      minutes at a rate of 278 nmol . kg-1 . min-1. After this time, samples of 
      arterial blood were collected rapidly at regular intervals for the assay of 
      plasma Ang-(1-7) levels by radioimmunoassay. Infusion of Ang-(1-7) had a minimal 
      effect on vehicle-treated SD rats but elicited a biphasic pressor/depressor 
      response in vehicle-treated SHR and TG+ rats. In lisinopril-treated rats, 
      Ang-(1-7) infusion increased blood pressure, whereas losartan treatment abolished 
      the pressor component of the response without altering the secondary fall in 
      arterial pressure. Combined treatment with lisinopril and losartan abolished the 
      cardiovascular response to Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. In vehicle-treated SD, SHR 
      and TG+ the half-life (t1/2) of Ang-(1-7) averaged 10+/-1, 10+/-1, and 9+/-1 
      seconds, respectively. Lisinopril alone or in combination with losartan produced 
      a statistically significant rise in the half-life of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains 
      of rats. Plasma clearance of Ang-(1-7) was significantly greater in the untreated 
      SD rats compared with either the SHR or TG+ rat. Lisinopril treatment was 
      associated with reduced clearance of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. Concurrent 
      experiments in pulmonary membranes from SD and SHR showed a statistically 
      significant inhibition of 125I-Ang-(1-7) metabolism in the presence of 
      lisinopril. These studies showed for the first time that the very short half-life 
      of Ang-(1-7) in the circulation is primarily accounted for peptide metabolism by 
      ACE. These findings suggest a novel role of ACE in the regulation of the 
      production and metabolism of the two primary active hormones of the renin 
      angiotensin system.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic approach to losartan in Marfan patients: a starting point to 
      improve dosing regimen?
PG  - 157-63
LID - 10.1515/dmpt-2016-0006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan is under evaluation for managing Marfan patients with aortic 
      root dilatation. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes convert losartan to E3174 active 
      metabolite. The aim of this study is to describe the distribution of CYP2C9*2, 
      CYP2C9*3, CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 defective alleles, according to losartan 
      tolerance in paediatric Marfan patients. METHODS: We genotyped 53 paediatric 
      Marfan patients treated with losartan. The rate of aortic root dilatation was 
      evaluated using the delta z-score variation. Differences in tolerated losartan 
      daily doses with respect to CYP metabolic classes were assessed through the 
      Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The losartan daily dose spans from 0.16 to 2.50 
      mg/kg (median 1.10 mg/kg). As we expect from the pharmacokinetics pathway, we 
      observe highest tolerated dose in CYP2C9 poor metabolisers (median 1.50 mg/kg, 
      interquartile range 1.08-1.67 mg/kg); however, this difference is not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal dose of angiotensin receptor 
      blocker is not known, and no data are available about losartan pharmacogenetic 
      profile in Marfan syndrome; we have proposed a strategy to tackle this issue 
      based on evaluating the major genetic polymorphisms involved in the losartan 
      conversion into active carboxylic acid metabolite. Further studies are needed to 
      support the use of genetic polymorphisms as predictors of the right dose of 
      losartan.

TI  - Repeated administration of berberine inhibits cytochromes P450 in humans.
PG  - 213-7
LID - 10.1007/s00228-011-1108-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Berberine is a plant alkaloid that is widely used to treat 
      gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. 
      Many studies have reported interactions between berberine-containing products and 
      cytochromes P450 (CYPs), but little is known about whether berberine alters CYP 
      activities in humans, especially after repeated doses. METHODS: A two-phase 
      randomized-crossover clinical study in healthy male subjects was performed. After 
      2 weeks of berberine (300 mg, t.i.d., p.o.) administration, midazolam, 
      omeprazole, dextromethorphan, losartan, and caffeine were used to evaluate enzyme 
      activities of CYP3A4, 2C19, 2D6, 2C9, and CYP1A2, respectively. RESULTS: A 
      decrease in CYP2D6 activity was observed as the 0-8 h urinary 
      dextromethorphan/dextrorphan increased ninefold (P < 0.01). In addition, 
      losartan/E-3174 ratio doubled (P < 0.01) after BBR administration, indicating a 
      decrease in CYP2C9 activity. CYP3A4 activity was also inhibited, as the C(max), 
      AUC(0-∞), and AUC(0-12) of midazolam were increased 38% (P < 0.05), 40% 
      (P < 0.01), and 37% (P < 0.05) after BBR treatment, respectively. Compared with 
      the placebo period, the T(max) and T(1/2) of midazolam during BBR administration 
      were prolonged from 3.03 ± 0.27 to 3.66 ± 0.37 h and 0.66 ± 0.08 to 0.99 ± 0.09 
      h, respectively; the oral clearance of midazolam was decreased 27% (P < 0.05); 
      and the phenotypic indices of 1 h midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam increased 59% 
      (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of the other probe drugs between placebo and the 
      BBR-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated administration of berberine (300 mg, 
      t.i.d., p.o.) decreased CYP2D6, 2C9, and CYP3A4 activities. Drug-drug 
      interactions should be considered when berberine is administered.

AB  - Recently, potent neuroprotective and anti-diabetic effects of 
      7β-(3-Ethyl-cis-crotonoyloxy)-1α-(2-methylbutyryloxy)-3,14-dehydro-Z-notonipetranone 
      (ECN), a sesquiterpenoid isolated from Tussilago farfara Linnaeus, have been 
      elucidated. To facilitate further pre-clinical evaluation in rats, an analytical 
      method for the determination of ECN in rat plasma was developed and optimized by 
      using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma samples 
      were pretreated by the protein precipitation method with an acetonitrile solution 
      of losartan (LST) as the internal standard. Chromatographic separation was 
      performed using a an Octadecyl-silica (ODS) column (2.6 µm, 100 x 4.6 mm) in the 
      isocratic mode. The mobile phase, comprising 10 mM ammonium formate in water pH 
      5.75) and acetonitrile (11:89, v/v), was eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. 
      Mass spectrometric detection was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring 
      mode with positive electrospray ionization, and the mass transitions of ECN and 
      LST were m/z 431.3 to 97.3 and m/z 423.1 to 207.2, respectively. The calibration 
      curves of spiked plasma samples were linear in the 10.0-10,000 ng/mL range (r(2) 
      > 0.996). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was determined as 10.0 ng/mL. 
      Validation was conducted in the LLOQ, and three quality control (QC) sample 
      levels (10.0, 25.0, 3750, and 7500 ng/mL) were studied. Among them, the relative 
      standard deviation for the within- and between-run precisions was under 9.90%, 
      and the relative error of the accuracies was within the -8.13% to 0.42% range. 
      The validated method was successfully employed to investigate the pharmacokinetic 
      properties of ECN in rats, which revealed the linear pharmacokinetic behavior of 
      ECN for the first time.

TI  - Evaluation of the clinical outcomes of switching patients from atorvastatin to 
      simvastatin and losartan to candesartan in a primary care setting: 2 years on.
PG  - 480-4
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01690.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This short report was designed to provide 2-year follow-up data from a 
      previous study carried out in a primary care practice in the UK to assess the 
      clinical and practical implications of switching to generic drugs. METHODS: All 
      patients previously switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin or losartan to 
      candesartan were reviewed retrospectively 2 years after the switch. Total serum 
      cholesterol and clinic blood pressure readings were used along with records of 
      cardiovascular events occuring during the 2 year period to assess the clinical 
      impact of the switch. RESULTS: Of the 69 patients switched from atorvastatin to 
      simvastatin between March and September 2005, 65 are still registered at the 
      practice. Of these, 61 (94%) are still on simvastatin and 58 (89%) on the same 
      dose. There was no significant change in mean total cholesterol over this 2 year 
      period [between 4.04 +/- 0.52 mmol/l prior to the switch and 3.90 +/- 0.63 mmol/l 
      2 years after the switch (p = 0.06)]. Of the 108 patients switched from losartan 
      to candesartan, 94 are still registered at the practice and taking an angiotensin 
      receptor blocker (ARB), 92 of these (98%) are still on candesartan and there was 
      a significant reduction in blood pressure 2 years post-switch [between 138/79 +/- 
      12.9/6.6 prior to the switch and 131/77 +/- 13.1/7.6 mmHg 2 years after the 
      switch (p<<0.05)]. No adverse events attributable to the switch were reported in 
      either group. CONCLUSION: This small study provides evidence that switching drugs 
      in primary care can be cost effective and safe in the medium term, if care is 
      taken with selection of patients and there is structured follow-up in place.

TI  - Evaluation of modafinil as a perpetrator of metabolic drug-drug interactions 
      using a model informed cocktail reaction phenotyping trial protocol.
PG  - 501-509
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13478 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the capacity for modafinil to be a perpetrator of metabolic 
      drug-drug interactions by altering cytochrome P450 activity following a single 
      dose and dosing to steady state. METHODS: A single centre, open label, single 
      sequence cocktail drug interaction trial. On days 0, 2 and 8 participants were 
      administered an oral drug cocktail comprising 100 mg caffeine, 30 mg 
      dextromethorphan, 25 mg losartan, 1 mg midazolam and 20 mg enteric-coated 
      omeprazole. Timed blood samples were collected prior to and for up to 6 h post 
      cocktail dosing. Between days 2 and 8 participants orally self-administered 
      200 mg modafinil each morning. RESULTS: Following a single 200 mg dose of 
      modafinil mean (± 95% CI) AUC ratios for caffeine, dextromethorphan, losartan, 
      midazolam and omeprazole were 0.95 (± 0.08), 1.01 (± 0.35), 0.97 (± 0.10), 0.98 
      (± 0.10) and 1.36 (± 0.06), respectively. Following dosing of modafinil to steady 
      state (200 mg for 7 days), AUC ratios for caffeine, dextromethorphan, losartan, 
      midazolam and omeprazole were 0.90 (± 0.16), 0.79 (± 0.09), 0.98 (± 0.11), 0.66 
      (± 0.12) and 1.90 (± 0.53), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data support 
      consideration of the risk of clinically relevant metabolic drug-drug interactions 
      perpetrated by modafinil when this drug is co-administered with drugs that are 
      primarily cleared by CYP2C19 (single modafinil dose or steady state modafinil 
      dosing) or CYP3A4 (steady state modafinil dosing only) catalysed metabolic 
      pathways.

TI  - Effects of Cytochrome P450 Inhibition and Induction on the Phenotyping Metrics of 
      the Basel Cocktail: A Randomized Crossover Study.
PG  - 79-91
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0294-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Activity of human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) shows 
      high inter-and intra-individual variability, which is determined by genetic and 
      non-genetic factors. Using a combination of CYP-specific probe drugs, phenotyping 
      cocktails allow simultaneous assessment of the activity of different CYP 
      isoforms. The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotyping metrics 
      of the Basel cocktail in healthy male subjects with induced and inhibited CYP 
      activity. METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, the probe drugs for 
      simultaneous phenotyping of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2B6 (efavirenz), CYP2C9 
      (losartan), 2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A4 (midazolam) were 
      administered to 16 subjects without pretreatment (baseline), after pretreatment 
      with a combination of CYP inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, ketoconazole, and 
      paroxetine), and after CYP induction with rifampicin. All subjects were 
      genotyped. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs and their main metabolites 
      and metabolic ratios 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after probe drug application were 
      determined in plasma and compared with the corresponding area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios. RESULTS: The Basel phenotyping cocktail 
      was well tolerated by all subjects independent of pretreatment. Good correlations 
      of metabolic ratios with AUC ratios of the corresponding probe drugs and their 
      metabolites for all three conditions (baseline, CYP inhibition, and CYP 
      induction) were found at 2 h after probe drug administration for CYP3A4, at 4 h 
      for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, and at 6 h for CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. While CYP inhibition 
      significantly changed AUC ratios and metabolic ratios at these time points for 
      all six CYP isoforms, CYP induction did not significantly change AUC ratios for 
      CYP2C9. For CYP3A4, total 1'-hydroxymidazolam concentrations after pretreatment 
      of samples with β-glucuronidase were needed to obtain adequate reflection of CYP 
      induction by the metabolic ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of CYP activity can be 
      detected with the Basel phenotyping cocktail for all six tested CYP isoforms at 
      the proposed time points. The AUC ratio of losartan:losartan carboxylic acid in 
      plasma does not seem suitable to detect induction of CYP2C9. The observed 
      metabolic ratios for inhibited and induced CYP activity need to be confirmed for 
      extensive metabolizers, and typical ratios for subjects with genetically altered 
      CYP activity will need to be established in subsequent studies.

TI  - Irbesartan substitution for valsartan or losartan in treating hypertension.
PG  - 1840-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether subjects whose therapy was converted from 
      losartan or valsartan to irbesartan maintained equivalent blood pressure 
      measurements, determine the safety and tolerability of irbesartan in the veteran 
      population, and assess the number of subjects attaining their goal blood pressure 
      before and after conversion. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records 
      for subjects whose antihypertensive was converted to irbesartan was conducted. 
      Demographic data were collected, and subjects' past medical histories were used 
      to determine their goal blood pressure. Blood pressures were compared at 
      baseline, 2 weeks, and 2 months after conversion to determine efficacy, and 
      adverse effect occurrence was compared between visits to assess safety. RESULTS: 
      Conversion was attempted in 79 subjects; 72 met the criteria for review. Mean 
      baseline, 2-week, and 2-month blood pressures for all subjects were 143/74, 
      139/72, and 139/73 mm Hg, respectively (p values NS). The number of subjects 
      achieving their goal blood pressure at each assessment visit was similar: 37.5% 
      at baseline, 43.4% at 2 weeks, and 31.9% at 2 months. Thirteen of the 72 subjects 
      discontinued irbesartan due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Irbesartan is an 
      appropriate substitution for valsartan or losartan.

TI  - Intrarenal Mas and AT(1) receptors play a role in mediating the excretory actions 
      of renal interstitial angiotensin-(1-7) infusion in anaesthetized rats.
PG  - 1700-1715
LID - 10.1113/EP086513 [doi]
AB  - What is the central question of this study? Dietary sodium manipulation alters 
      the magnitude of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]-induced natriuresis. The present 
      study sought to determine whether this was related to relative changes in the 
      activity of intrarenal Mas and/or AT(1) receptors. What is the main finding and 
      its importance? Angiotensin-(1-7)-induced diuresis and natriuresis is mediated by 
      intrarenal Mas receptors. However, intrarenal AT(1) receptor blockade also had an 
      inhibitory effect on Ang-(1-7)-induced natriuresis and diuresis. Thus, 
      Ang-(1-7)-induced increases in sodium and water excretion are dependent upon 
      functional Mas and AT(1) receptors. We investigated whether angiotensin-(1-7) 
      [Ang-(1-7)]-induced renal haemodynamic and excretory actions were solely 
      dependent upon intrarenal Mas receptor activation or required functional 
      angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1) ) receptors. The renin-angiotensin system was 
      enhanced in anaesthetized rats by prior manipulation of dietary sodium intake. 
      Angiotensin-(1-7) and AT(1) and Mas receptor antagonists were infused into the 
      kidney at the corticomedullary border. Mas receptor expression was measured in 
      the kidney. Mean arterial pressure, urine flow and fractional sodium excretion 
      were 93 ± 4 mmHg, 46.1 ± 15.7 μl min(-1)  kg(-1) and 1.4 ± 0.3%, respectively, in 
      the normal-sodium group and 91 ± 2 mmHg, 19.1 ± 3.3 μl min(-1)  kg(-1) and 
      0.7 ± 0.2%, respectively, in the low-sodium group. Angiotensin-(1-7) infusion had 
      no effect on mean arterial pressure in rats receiving a normal-sodium diet but 
      decreased it by 4 ± 5% in rats receiving a low-sodium diet (P < 0.05). 
      Interstitial Ang-(1-7) infusion increased urine flow twofold and fractional 
      sodium excretion threefold (P < 0.05) in rats receiving a normal-sodium diet and 
      to a greater extent, approximately three- and fourfold, respectively, in rats 
      receiving the low-sodium diet (both P < 0.05). Angiotensin-(1-7)-induced 
      increases in urine flow and fractional sodium excretion were absent in both 
      dietary groups during intrarenal AT(1) or Mas receptor inhibition after either 
      losartan or A-779, respectively. Thus, AT(1) receptor activation, as well as Mas 
      receptor activation, plays an essential role in mediating Ang-(1-7)-induced 
      natriuresis and diuresis. Whether this is because Ang-(1-7) partly antagonizes 
      AT(1) receptors or whether Ang-(1-7)-induced natriuresis is mediated through 
      AT(1) -Mas receptor dimerization remains unclear.

TI  - A new class of antihypertensive therapy: angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
PG  - 849-60
AB  - Despite the availability of safe and efficacious antihypertensive agents, 
      hypertension continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality in the 
      United States. Losartan, the first of a new class of agents, the angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonists, can be administered as monotherapy in the treatment of 
      hypertension or to complement existing therapy. The angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists block the effects of angiotensin II through preferential binding to 
      angiotensin II receptor subtype AT1 on the cell membrane. Compared with 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, they may provide more complete blockade 
      of the renin-angiotensin system and be associated with a lower frequency of cough 
      as a side effect.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible, and 
      multifactorial brain disorder that gradually and insidiously destroys 
      individual's memory, thinking, and other cognitive abilities. AREAS COVERED: In 
      this perspective, the authors examine the complex and multifactorial nature of 
      Alzheimer's disease and believe that the best approach to develop new drugs is 
      the MTDL strategy, which obviously faces several challenges. These challenges 
      include identifying the key combination of targets and their suitability for 
      coordinated actions, as well as developing an acceptable pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicological profile to deliver a drug candidate. EXPERT OPINION: Since calcium 
      plays a crucial role in the pathology of AD, a polypharmacological approach with 
      calcium channel blockers reinforced by activities targeting other factors 
      involved in AD is a serious option in our opinion. This is exemplified by a phase 
      III clinical trial using a drug combination approach with Losartan, Amlodipine (a 
      calcium channel blocker), and Atorvastatin, as well as several MTDL-based calcium 
      channel blockade approaches with a promising in vitro and in vivo profile.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of DALI-LDL-apheresis in two patients treated with the 
      angiotensin II-receptor 1 antagonist losartan.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - Direct adsorption of lipids (DALI) is the first low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL)-apheresis technique capable of adsorbing LDL and lipoprotein (a) directly 
      from whole blood. The adsorber consists of negatively charged polyacrylate 
      ligands linked to a Eupergit matrix. Negatively charged ligands give rise to 
      activation of bradykinin, which is rapidly degraded by the angiotensin converting 
      enzyme (ACE). Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are contraindicated 
      in DALI-LDL-apheresis. This is the first paper to describe the efficacy and 
      safety of DALI-LDL-apheresis in patients treated with 50 mg of the angiotensin 
      II-receptor 1 antagonist (ARA) losartan. Two hypercholesterolemic patients were 
      treated for 79 patient months with weekly or biweekly DALI sessions (N = 221 
      sessions). Approximately 1.4 patient blood volumes were treated per session. 
      Acute reductions of LDL-cholesterol (63%) and lipoprotein (a) (62%) exceeded 60% 
      and laboratory safety parameters remained in the apheresis typical range. Mean 
      bradykinin plasma levels peaked in the efferent line post-adsorber at 1000 mL of 
      treated blood volume; 467 fmol/mL (N = 6 sessions) in the ARA-treated patients 
      and 671 fmol/mL (N = 9 sessions) in a control group of three DALI patients 
      without ARA medication (P = 0.69, n.s.). Clinically, the DALI sessions for the 
      ARA-treated patients were completely uneventful and blood pressure was not 
      significantly different in the two groups. In summary, according to this 
      retrospective pilot study, DALI-LDL-apheresis was shown for the first time to be 
      safe and effective in patients on ARA medication.

TI  - Interaction of angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers with ATP-binding cassette 
      transporters.
PG  - 150-61
LID - 10.1002/bdd.699 [doi]
AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), 
      multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs/ABCCs) and breast cancer 
      resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) transport numerous drugs thus regulating their 
      absorption, distribution and excretion. Angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers 
      (ARBs), used to treat hypertension and heart failure, are commonly administered 
      in combination therapy. However, their interaction potential is not well studied 
      and their effect on ABC-transporters remains elusive. The study therefore aimed 
      to elucidate the effect of various ARBs (telmisartan, candesartan, 
      candesartan-cilexetil, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, olmesartan-medoxomil, 
      eprosartan) on ABC-transporter activity in vitro. P-gp inhibition was assessed by 
      calcein assay, BCRP inhibition by pheophorbide A efflux assay, and MRP2 
      inhibition by a MRP2 PREDIVEZ Kit. Induction of P-gp, BCRP and MRP2 was assessed 
      by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and for P-gp also in 
      a functional assay. Telmisartan was identified as one of the most potent 
      inhibitors of P-gp currently known (IC(50)=0.38+/-0.2 microM for murine P-gp) and 
      it also inhibited human BCRP (IC(50)=16.9+/-8.1 microM) and human MRP2 
      (IC(50)=25.4+/-0.6 microM). Moreover, the prodrug candesartan-cilexetil, but not 
      candesartan itself, significantly inhibited P-gp and BCRP activity. None of the 
      compounds tested induced mRNA transcription of P-gp or BCRP but eprosartan and 
      olmesartan induced MRP2 mRNA expression. In conclusion, telmisartan substantially 
      differed from other ARBs with respect to its potential to inhibit 
      ABC-transporters relevant for drug pharmacokinetics and tissue defense. These 
      findings may explain the known interaction of telmisartan with digoxin and 
      suggest that it may modulate the bioavailability of drugs whose absorption is 
      restricted by P-gp and possibly also by BCRP or MRP2.

TI  - Putting the efficacy of candesartan cilexetil into perspective: a review of new 
      comparative data.
PG  - S33-41
AB  - Candesartan is one of the first angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) to 
      be developed. It binds tightly to and dissociates slowly from the angiotensin 
      subtype 1 (AT1) receptor in vitro. These binding characteristics differ from 
      those of losartan, which demonstrates lower affinity and faster dissociation from 
      the AT1 receptor. Candesartan causes long-lasting antagonism of the vascular 
      contractile response to angiotensin II compared with irbesartan, losartan or the 
      active metabolite of losartan - EXP-3174. While there are relatively few 
      distinctions that can be made between the AIIRAs in terms of their 
      pharmacokinetic profiles, the antagonistic potency of candesartan cilexetil at 
      the AT1 receptor over 24 h clearly differentiates it from other members of its 
      class. These differences are reflected in the antihypertensive efficacy and 
      duration of action of candesartan in clinical trials.

TI  - Prediction of the Area under the Curve Using Limited-Point Blood Sampling in a 
      Cocktail Study to Assess Multiple CYP Activities.
PG  - 762-770
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b20-00691 [doi]
AB  - A cocktail study is an in vivo evaluation method to assess multiple CYP 
      activities via a single trial and single administration of a cocktail drug that 
      is a combination of multiple CYP substrates. However, multiple blood samples are 
      required to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a CYP probe drug. A limited-point 
      sampling method is generally beneficial in clinical studies because of the 
      simplified protocol and reduced participant burden. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate whether a limited-point plasma concentration analysis of CYP substrates 
      in a cocktail drug could predict their area under the curve (AUC). We created 
      prediction models of five CYP substrates (caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, 
      dextromethorphan, and midazolam) using multiple linear regressions from the data 
      of two cocktail studies, and then performed predictability analysis of these 
      models using data derived from data in the co-administration with inducer 
      (rifampicin) and inhibitors (fluvoxamine and cimetidine). For the administration 
      of inhibitors, the AUC prediction accuracy (mean absolute error (MAE)) were 
      <39.5% in Model 1 and <26.2% in Model 2 which were created using 1- and 4-point 
      sampling data. MAE shows larger values in the administration of inducer in 
      compared with the administration of inhibitors. The accuracy of the prediction in 
      Model 2 could be acceptable for screening of inhibitions. MAE for caffeine, 
      dextromethorphan, and midazolam were acceptable in the model that used 4 sampling 
      points from all data. The use of this method could reduce the burden on the 
      subject and make it possible to evaluate each AUC in a minimally invasive manner.

AB  - Noscapine and glucosamine reportedly interact with warfarin. We investigated the 
      effects of these drugs on various cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity markers. Twelve 
      healthy subjects were phenotyped at baseline and during separate treatments with 
      noscapine and glucosamine. Whereas glucosamine had no significant effect on CYP 
      activity, noscapine caused marked inhibition of CYP2C9 (4.9-fold increase in 
      urinary losartan/E3174 ratio) and CYP2C19 (3.6-fold increase in the plasma 
      omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole ratio). Noscapine-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9 
      may explain the interaction with warfarin.

TI  - Renal expression of constitutive NOS and DDAH: separate effects of salt intake 
      and angiotensin.
PG  - 2075-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is generated from NO synthase (NOS) isoforms. These 
      enzymes can be inhibited by asymmetric dimethylarginine, which is inactivated by 
      N(G)-N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). The neuroneal (nNOS) 
      type I and endothelial (eNOS) type III constitutive NOS isoforms are expressed 
      predominantly in the macula densa and microvascular endothelium of the renal 
      cortex, respectively. DDAH is expressed at sites of NOS expression. Since NO may 
      coordinate the renal responses to angiotensin II (Ang II) and changes in salt 
      intake, we tested the hypothesis that salt intake regulates the expression of 
      nNOS, eNOS and DDAH by Ang II acting on type 1 (AT(1)) receptors. METHODS: Groups 
      (N = 6) of rats were adapted to low-salt (LS) or high-salt (HS) intakes for 10 
      days. Other groups of LS and HS rats received the AT(1) receptor antagonist 
      losartan for six days (to test the effects of salt independent of AT(1) 
      receptors). A further group of HS rats received an infusion of Ang II for six 
      days (to test the effect of Ang II independent of salt intake). RESULTS: Compared 
      with HS rats, there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in LS rats of nNOS 
      protein in kidney and immunohistochemical expression in the macula densa, and of 
      eNOS protein expression and immunohistochemical expression in the microvascular 
      endothelium, and of DDAH protein expression. Losartan prevented these effects of 
      salt on the expression of eNOS or DDAH, both of which were also increased by Ang 
      II infusions in HS rats. In contrast, losartan did not prevent the effects of 
      salt on nNOS expression, which was unresponsive to Ang II infusion. The 
      generation of NO(2)(-) released by slices of renal cortex, in the presence of 
      saturating concentrations of L-arginine, was increased by LS, compared to HS, 
      independent of losartan and by Ang II during HS. CONCLUSION: The expressions of 
      eNOS in cortical microvascular endothelium and DDAH in kidney are enhanced by Ang 
      II acting on AT(1) receptors. The expression of nNOS in the macula densa is 
      enhanced by salt restriction independent of Ang II or AT(1) receptors.

TI  - Autoradiographic characterization of angiotensin II receptor subtypes in rat 
      intestine.
PG  - G21-7
AB  - Angiotensin II is known to regulate motility and ion and water absorption in the 
      intestine. These effects are presumed to be mediated by angiotensin II (ANG II) 
      receptors that are present in both mucosal and muscular layers throughout the 
      intestine. To evaluate tissue density and distribution of ANG II receptor 
      subtypes (AT1 and AT2), we performed an in situ autoradiographic study on 
      jejunum, ileum, and colon of Sprague-Dawley rats. Tissue sections (10 microns) 
      were incubated with 500 pM 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]ANG II, fixed with paraformaldehyde 
      vapors, and coated with photographic emulsion. Binding specificity was verified 
      by competition with unlabeled [Sar1]ANG II (10 microM). AT1 and AT2 receptor 
      distribution was characterized by competition with the nonpeptide antagonists 
      losartan (10 microM) and PD123177 (10 microM), respectively, and the density of 
      receptors was quantified by counting the silver grains overlying the different 
      layers of intestinal wall. Specific binding was moderately abundant in the mucosa 
      and the muscularis of both jejunum and ileum, whereas no binding was present in 
      the submucosa and the serosa. Losartan inhibited 86% of radioligand binding to 
      the mucosa in both jejunum and ileum, whereas PD123177 inhibited only 10%. The 
      combination of the two compounds inhibited 96% of specific binding. In the colon, 
      binding was significantly more abundant in the muscularis than in the mucosa. In 
      this segment, losartan inhibited 90% and PD123177 16% of specific binding to 
      muscularis. The combination of these compounds reduced binding by 97%. Thus the 
      predominant ANG II receptor in all intestinal segments is AT1, but a small 
      population of AT2 receptors also seems to be present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

LID - 10.3109/03639045.2012.692377 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The present study was planned to investigate the effect of absorption 
      enhancers on the microstructure of Losartan potassium gel and hence its influence 
      on the diffusion of Losartan potassium across nasal mucosa. METHOD: Losartan 
      potassium loaded carbopol gel (1% w/v) with and without absorption enhancers was 
      prepared. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and ethanol were used as absorption 
      enhancers. Microstructural elucidation of prepared gels was done using shear 
      rheology. Ex vivo drug release studies were performed on the prepared gels. 
      RESULTS: It was observed that the absorption enhancers PEG 4000 and ethanol 
      altered the gel microstructure. The prepared gels were viscoelastic in nature 
      suggesting their suitability for topical application. Permeability coefficient of 
      Losartan potassium loaded into gels was found to be inversely proportional to the 
      storage modulus. Thus increase in storage modulus lead to slow drug diffusion. 
      CONCLUSION: The current study emphasizes on the fact that selection of polymeric 
      carrier for nasal drug delivery and/or absorption enhancer strongly influence the 
      microstructure of the gel and hence the pharmaceutical performance of the 
      formulation.

TI  - Impact of Probe Substrate Selection on Cytochrome P450 Reaction Phenotyping Using 
      the Relative Activity Factor.
PG  - 183-189
LID - 10.1124/dmd.116.073510 [doi]
AB  - Accurately assessing the contribution of cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms to 
      overall metabolic clearance is important for prediction of clinical drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs). The relative activity factor (RAF) approach in P450 reaction 
      phenotyping assumes that the interaction between P450-selective probes and 
      testing systems is the same as the interaction of drug candidate with those 
      systems. To test this assumption, an intersystem clearance ratio (ICR) was 
      created to evaluate the difference in values between RAF-scaled intrinsic 
      clearance (CL(int)) and measured CL(int) in human liver microsomes (HLMs). The 
      RAF value for CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 derived from a particular P450-selective probe 
      reaction was applied to calculate RAF-scaled CL(int) for other probe reactions of 
      the same P450 isoform in a crossover manner and compared with the measured HLM 
      CL(int) When RAF derived from midazolam or nifedipine was used for CYP3A4, the 
      ICR for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation was 31 and 25, respectively, suggesting 
      significantly diverse interactions of CYP3A4 probes with the testing systems. 
      Such ICR differences were less profound among probes for CYP2C9. In addition, 
      these RAF values were applied to losartan and meloxicam, whose metabolism is 
      mostly CYP2C9 mediated. Only using the RAF derived from testosterone for CYP3A4 
      produced the expected CYP2C9 contribution of 72%-87% and 47%-69% for metabolism 
      of losartan and meloxicam, respectively. RAF derived from other CYP3A4 probes 
      would have attributed predominantly to CYP3A4 and led to incorrect prediction of 
      DDIs. Our study demonstrates a significant impact of probe substrate selection on 
      P450 phenotyping using the RAF approach, and the ICR may provide a potential 
      solution.

AB  - Drug transporters and CYP enzymes are important sources of pharmacokinetics (PK) 
      variability in drug responses and can cause various pharmacological and 
      toxicological consequences, leading to either toxicity or an insufficient 
      pharmacological effect. In recent years, the cocktail approach was developed to 
      determine in vivo CYP and transporters activities, but these approaches are 
      somewhat limited. We described the development and validation of three sensitive 
      and specific LC-MS/MS assays for the determination of P-gp and major human CYP 
      isoenzyme activities following oral administration of a drug cocktail of 
      subtherapeutic doses (lower than 10 times) of caffeine (CAF), omeprazole (OME), 
      losartan (LOS), midazolam (MDZ), metoprolol (METO) and fexofenadine (FEX) in 
      healthy volunteers. The three validated methods were selective for all tested 
      analytes. No interference or matrix effect was observed for the mass transition 
      and retention times for all compounds monitored. Additionally, assays were linear 
      over a wide range, and limits of quantification varied between 0.01-5 ng/mL 
      plasma. The coefficients of variation obtained in the precision studies and the 
      inter- and intra-assay accuracies were less than 15%, guaranteeing the 
      reproducibility and repeatability of the results. All substrates and metabolites 
      were stable in plasma during freeze-thaw cycles. Three healthy volunteers were 
      selected based on genotyping for CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. One volunteer was 
      genotyped as an extensive metabolizer (EM) for all tested CYP isoforms, one 
      volunteer was genotyped as a poor metabolizer (PM) for the CYP2C9 isoform 
      (CYP2C9*3/*3), and one volunteer was genotyped as a PM for the CYP2D6 isoform 
      (CYP2D6*4/*4). The methods allowed the quantification of all analytes over the 
      entire sampling period (12 h) in all studied genotypes. Thus, the analytical 
      methods described here were sufficiently sensitive for use in low-dose 
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Grapefruit juice activates P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport.
PG  - 478-85
AB  - PURPOSE: Grapefruit juice (GJ) is known to increase the oral bioavailability of 
      many CYP3A-substrates by inhibiting intestinal phase-I metabolism. However, the 
      magnitude of AUC increase is often insignificant and highly variable. Since we 
      earlier suggested that CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) form a concerted barrier 
      to drug absorption, we investigated the role of P-gp in GJ-drug interactions. 
      METHODS: The transcellular bidirectional flux of drugs that are (i) CYP3A-and/or 
      P-gp substrates (Vinblastine, Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Fexofenadine, Losartan) or 
      that are (ii) primary CYP3A-substrates (Felodipine, Nifedipine) was evaluated 
      across MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers with or without GJ, verifying monolayer 
      integrity at all times. RESULTS: While both apical-to-basal (A-B) and 
      basal-to-apical (B-A) fluxes of all CYP3A/P-gp substrates tested were increased 
      in the presence of GJ, the resulting net efflux (B-A/A-B) was in all cases 
      significantly greater with GJ than control (Vin, 28.0 vs. 5.1; CsA, 9.9 vs. 2.8; 
      Dig, 22. 9 vs. 14.7, Fex, 22.3 vs. 11.1, Los, 39.6 vs. 26). In contrast, no such 
      GJ flux effect was observed with Fel and Nif, substrates of CYP3A only (2 vs. 1.7 
      and 1.2 vs. 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: GJ significantly activates P-gp-mediated efflux of 
      drugs that are substrates of P-gp, potentially partially counteracting the 
      CYP3A-inhibitory effects of GJ.

TI  - Permeation of losartan across human respiratory epithelium: an in vitro study 
      with Calu-3 cells.
PG  - 395-405

AB  - The potential for nasal delivery of losartan, a drug with poor oral 
      bioavailability, was investigated using Calu-3 cells. Epithelial permeation of 
      the drug with or without dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CD) and glycocholate 
      was investigated. Possible transport mechanism of the compound and epithelial 
      mucosal tolerance were screened. Reversibility of epithelial membrane 
      perturbation was also investigated by measuring transepithelial electrical 
      resistance (TEER) recovery over a 24-h period following drug formulation 
      exposure. The permeability coefficient of losartan was 1.3 + or - 0.5 x 10(-6) cm 
      s(-1). This flux was not significantly different from that of formulations 
      containing DM-beta-CD (0.5 and 1.0%) or glycocholate (0.5%). However, the 
      formulation with 1.0% glycocholate significantly increased losartan permeation 
      7-fold. Losartan flux across the cells was concentration-dependent. Serosal to 
      mucosal permeation was significantly higher than mucosal to serosal permeation. 
      Concentration-dependency, as well as polarity in transport indicated that the 
      flux of the compound across Calu-3 cells was not limited to passive diffusion. 
      Cells exposed to DM-beta-CD (0.5 and 1.0%) and glycocholate (0.5%) caused no 
      significant change in TEER and mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (MDH). The 
      results of the study showed that losartan may be a suitable drug candidate for 
      nasal delivery.

TI  - Telmisartan is more effective than losartan in reducing proteinuria in patients 
      with diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 364-9

AB  - In patients with diabetic nephropathy, lowering blood pressure and reducing 
      proteinuria by over 30% correlates with a slower progression to kidney failure. 
      We compared two different angiotensin receptor-blockers in a double blind, 
      prospective trial of 860 patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood pressure 
      levels was over 130/80 mmHg or who were receiving antihypertensive medication(s) 
      and who had a morning spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio of 700 or more. 
      Patients were randomized to telmisartan (a highly lipophilic agent with a long 
      half-life) or losartan (with low lipophilicity and short half-life). The primary 
      endpoint was the difference in the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio between 
      the groups at 52 weeks. The geometric coefficient of variation and the mean of 
      the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio fell in both groups at 52 weeks but both 
      were significantly greater for the telmisartan compared to the losartan cohort. 
      Mean systolic blood pressure reductions were not significantly different between 
      groups at trial end. We conclude that telmisartan is superior to losartan in 
      reducing proteinuria in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy, despite 
      a similar reduction in blood pressure.

TI  - The impact of hepatic uptake on the pharmacokinetics of organic anions.
PG  - 1930-8
LID - 10.1124/dmd.111.039842 [doi]
AB  - The disposition of seven marketed and two AstraZeneca acid (organic anion) 
      compounds with a range of volume of distribution at steady state (V(ss)) and 
      clearance have been profiled in rat and dog. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
      along with liver and muscle tissue levels were collected, and their contributions 
      to total V(ss) were calculated. The physiologically based prediction of V(ss) 
      correlated (all predictions within 2-fold) with the V(ss) obtained from plasma PK 
      analysis. The V(ss) of the acid drugs with atypically high values could be 
      explained by significant sequestering of compound to the liver. A "media loss" in 
      the in vitro hepatocyte assay that monitors loss of compound from the incubation 
      media along with physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling was assessed for its 
      ability to accurately predict the impact of hepatic uptake on both clearance and 
      V(ss). This methodology significantly improved the prediction of metabolic in 
      vivo clearance compared with standard hepatocyte scaling approaches that do not 
      take into account hepatic uptake. Predictions of V(ss) from the media loss assay 
      also correlate with the measured values from plasma PK analysis. However, hepatic 
      uptake will have little overall impact on half-life, because of the concomitant 
      impact on both Cl and V(ss), as long as hepatic extraction is not high. The 
      methodology described here is particularly useful when there is no allometric 
      relationship between species as a result of interspecies differences in liver 
      uptake. In this situation, the potential use of human hepatocytes combined with 
      PBPK modeling avoids the question of which species pharmacokinetics is most 
      predictive to humans.

TI  - Dietary Sodium Suppresses Digestive Efficiency via the Renin-Angiotensin System.
PG  - 11123
LID - 10.1038/srep11123 [doi]
LID - 11123
AB  - Dietary fats and sodium are both palatable and are hypothesized to 
      synergistically contribute to ingestive behavior and thereby obesity. Contrary to 
      this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that 
      was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of 
      dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in 
      digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, 
      or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed 
      the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the 
      AT1 receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT2 
      receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, 
      genetic deletion of the AT2 receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed 
      digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore 
      the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and 
      implicate dietary sodium, the renin-angiotensin system, and the AT2 receptor in 
      the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient 
      composition of the diet. These findings highlight the need for greater 
      understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology, and prompt more uniform 
      assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance.

TI  - High-sensitivity liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the 
      simultaneous determination of five drugs and their cytochrome P450-specific probe 
      metabolites in human plasma.
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.03.014 [doi]
AB  - A sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method 
      with electrospray ionization was developed for the simultaneous quantitation of 
      five probe drugs and their metabolites in human plasma for assessing the in vivo 
      activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP). CYP isoform specific substrates and their 
      metabolites of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (losartan), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 
      (dextromethorphan) and CYP3A (midazolam) were all simultaneously analyzed using 
      LC-MS/MS after administration of a mixture of five drugs (i.e., a "cocktail 
      approach") to healthy volunteers. The assay uses propranolol as an internal 
      standard; dual liquid extraction; a Xbridge MS C(18) (100 mm × 2.1mm, 3.5 μm) 
      column; a gradient mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile (7/3→3/7); mass 
      spectrometric detection in positive ion mode. The method was validated from 5 to 
      500 ng/mL for caffeine and paraxanthine, 0.1-40 ng/mL for losartan and EXP3174, 
      0.05-20 ng/mL for omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 0.008-0.8 ng/mL for 
      dextromethorphan and dextrorphan, 0.01-1.0 ng/mL for midazolam, and 0.04-4 ng/mL 
      for 1'-hydroxymidazolam. The intra- and inter-day precision over the 
      concentration ranges for all analytes were lower than 12.5% and 13.8% (relative 
      standard deviation, %RSD), and accuracy was between 86.5% and 108.4% and between

      allowed a pharmacokinetic study in subjects receiving doses 10-100 times lower 
      than typical therapeutic doses.

TI  - Formulation and in vitro evaluation of directly compressed controlled release 
      tablets designed from the Co-precipitates.
PG  - 455-461
AB  - Controlled release dosage forms provide sustained therapeutics effects for 
      prolonged period of time and improve patient compliance. In present study, 
      controlled release co-precipitates of Metoprolol Tartrate and Losartan Potassium 
      were prepared by solvent evaporation method using polymers such as Eudragit RL 
      100 and Carbopol 974PNF and controlled release tablets were directly compressed 
      into tablets. In-vitro dissolution of controlled release co-precipitates were 
      performed by USP Method-II (paddle method) and tablets were evaluated by USP 
      Method-I (rotating basket method) in phosphate buffer (PH 6.8) using pharma test 
      dissolution apparatus. The temperature was maintained constant at 37±1.0°C and 
      the rotation speed of paddle and basket was kept constant at 100rpm. Drug release 
      mechanisms were determined by applying Power Law kinetic model. The difference 
      and similarity of dissolution profiles test formulations with reference standards 
      were also determined by applying difference factor (f(1)) and similarity factor 
      (f(2)). The results showed that the controlled release co-precipitates with 
      polymer Eudragit RL 100 of both the drug extended the drug release rates for 10 
      hours and those having polymer Carbopol 974P NF extended the drug release rates 
      for 12 hours. The controlled release tablets prepared from controlled release 
      co-precipitates extended the drugs release up to 24 hours with both the polymers. 
      The drug was released by all tests anomalous non fickian mechanism except F1 and 
      F5 do not follow Power Law. The f(1) and f(2) values obtained were not in 
      acceptable limits except F15 whose values were in acceptable limits. It is 
      concluded from the present study that polymers (Eudragit RL 100 and Carbopol 974P 
      NF) can be efficiently used in development of controlled release dosage forms 
      having predictable kinetics.

TI  - Drug-disease interactions: losartan effect is not downregulated by rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 1344-55
AB  - Inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, reduce response to calcium 
      channel and beta-adrenergic antagonists but not the angiotensin II type 1 
      receptor (AT(1)R) antagonist valsartan. Inflammation also reduces clearance of 
      some drugs or active metabolite, thereby reducing response. Active (n = 14) and 
      controlled rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12) and healthy subjects (n = 12) received 
      losartan (100 mg). Blood pressures were measured, and samples were taken for 
      pharmacokinetic and inflammatory mediator concentration determination. Active 
      disease significantly increased arthritic index, nitric oxide, and Creactive 
      protein. Although no between-group difference in plasma losartan 
      concentration-time curves was observed, concentrations of the active metabolite, 
      EXP 3174, were significantly reduced by arthritis. This, however, was not 
      accompanied by reduced clinical response. One subject produced no detectable 
      concentrations of EXP 3174 likely due to insufficient CYP2C9 activity. Despite 
      reduced concentrations of the active metabolite, AT1R antagonists potency does 
      not appear to be reduced by inflammation.

AB  - The aim was to develop gastroretentive drug delivery systems (GRDDSs) by 
      combining floating and swelling. GRDDS tablets formulated with 
      hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), chitosan (CS) and sodium bicarbonate (SB) for 
      evaluating floating capacity (floating lag time and duration) and swelling 
      characteristics. CS was used because it was swellable in acidic media and 
      biocompatible. Losartan was incorporated into the optimized formulations for 
      sustained release profiling. Results demonstrated that for those formulations at 
      HEC:CS ratio of 5:5 containing CS, both the floating lag time and floating 
      duration were optimal and reached the preferred swelling effect and sustain for 
      24h. Adding SB improved the floating capabilities for all ratios of HEC:CS, but 
      reduced the swelling ability for those formulations containing a higher portion 
      of low viscosity grade CS. Sustained release profiles for losartan in those 
      formulations were achievable, using all viscosity grades of CS at all examined 
      HEC:CS ratios; however, it is more adjustable at different HEC:CS ratios when 
      using a lower viscosity grade of CS. Optimized GRDDS formulations for losartan 
      composed of an equivalent ratio of HEC to CS with 20mg SB resulted in the tablets 
      floating for more than 16 h and an adjustable sustained release profile.

TI  - Functional evidence that the angiotensin antagonist losartan crosses the 
      blood-brain barrier in the rat.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - Losartan is a novel nonpeptidergic antagonist of angiotensin (ANG) II subtype 1 
      (AT1) receptors, which effectively lowers blood pressure in high-renin 
      hypertensive rat and blocks the pressor response to systemic ANG II. It is well 
      known that high densities of ANG II receptors exist in the hypothalamic 
      paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In addition, activation of putative 
      angiotensinergic afferents to the PVN originating in subfornical organ (SFO) 
      elevates blood pressure and facilitates the activity of PVN neurons. We report 
      here that systemic administration of losartan (3 mg/kg) significantly attenuates 
      the pressor response to electrical stimulation of SFO. The excitatory responses 
      of PVN neurons to SFO stimulation or local pressure microinjection of ANG II were 
      also significantly inhibited in 58.8% and 88.9% of PVN cells, respectively, by 
      intravenous administration of losartan. These pharmacological effects were rapid 
      and reversible, and were accompanied by little change of basal arterial blood 
      pressure or spontaneous neuronal activity. These observations suggest that 
      systemic losartan crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and acts at AT1 receptors 
      within the PVN.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of 5-fluorouracil on cytochrome P450 2C9 activity in cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Drug interactions have been reported between 5-fluorouracil and cytochrome P450 
      2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates, S-warfarin and phenytoin. This study was performed to 
      determine the influence of 5-fluorouracil on cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) 
      activity in colorectal cancer patients (n=17) receiving 5-fluorouracil. Losartan 
      was used as a marker to assess CYP2C9 activity. Losartan and its CYP2C9 dependent 
      metabolite, E-3174, were determined in urine. The ratios of urinary 
      losartan/E-3174 before and after the 5-fluorouracil treatment were compared for 
      each patient. Genotyping was performed to detect the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. At 
      the end of the first cycle of 5-fluorouracil, losartan/E-3174 ratio was increased 
      by 28.0% compared to the pre-treatment values (P=0.15). In five patients 
      recruited for phenotyping after three 5-fluorouracil cycles, the metabolic ratio 
      was increased significantly by 5.3 times (P=0.03). The results suggest that in 
      most patients 5-fluorouracil inhibited CYP2C9 activity. This inhibition was more 
      pronounced when the total administered dose increased. This finding may help 
      explain the mechanism of interaction between 5-fluorouracil and CYP2C9 
      substrates.

TI  - AT1 receptors and the actin cytoskeleton during angiotensin II treatment.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: The response of proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs) to angiotensin II 
      is mediated by specific type 1 receptors found on both apical and basolateral 
      surface membrane cells. After ligand association with type 1 receptors, different 
      signaling pathways are triggered and determine changes in fluid absorption (Jv). 
      The presence of AT1 and actin cytoskeleton, which are directly related to Jv, can 
      undergo changes in distribution based on the actions of AngII and losartan. 
      METHODS: Using a microperfusion technique and immunohistochemistry analysis, we 
      investigated the basolateral action in PCTs, of AngII and/or losartan on Jv in 
      rabbits, with regard to AT1 and actin cytoskeleton. RESULTS: AngII increased Jv, 
      while in contrast, losartan and combined AngII + losartan led to its decrease. 
      AngII did not change fluorescence intensity of AT1 receptors on tubular 
      membranes, while losartan and AngII + losartan demonstrated a slight increase 
      after treatment. On the other hand, AngII increased the fluorescence intensity of 
      actin cytoskeleton, while losartan induced a decrease. AngII + losartan led actin 
      cytoskeleton having a higher fluorescence intensity than in the control group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we demonstrated that treatment of the 
      basolateral side of PCT cells with AngII and losartan could lead to changes in 
      absorptive tubular function. Important alterations were detected in AT1 receptor 
      fluorescence on the luminal and basolateral membranes, and changes in F-actin 
      cytoskeleton were verified by fluorescence following these protocols.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and evaluate the frequency, severity, mechanism and common 
      pairs of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in prescriptions by consultants in 
      medicine outpatient department. METHODS: This cross sectional descriptive study 
      was done by Pharmacology department of Bahria University Medical & Dental College 
      (BUMDC) in medicine outpatient department (OPD) of a private hospital in Karachi 
      from December 2015 to January 2016. A total of 220 prescriptions written by 
      consultants were collected. Medications given with patient's diagnosis were 
      recorded. Drugs were analyzed for interactions by utilizing Medscape drug 
      interaction checker, drugs.com checker and stockley`s drug interactions index. 
      Two hundred eleven prescriptions were selected while remaining were excluded from 
      the study because of unavailability of the prescribed drugs in the drug 
      interaction checkers. RESULTS: In 211 prescriptions, two common diagnoses were 
      diabetes mellitus (28.43%) and hypertension (27.96%). A total of 978 medications 
      were given. Mean number of medications per prescription was 4.6. A total of 369 
      drug-drug interactions were identified in 211 prescriptions (175%). They were 
      serious 4.33%, significant 66.12% and minor 29.53%. Pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic interactions were 37.94% and 51.21% respectively while 10.84% had 
      unknown mechanism. Number wise common pairs of DDIs were Omeprazole-Losartan (S), 
      Gabapentine- Acetaminophen (M), Losartan-Diclofenac (S). CONCLUSION: The 
      frequency of DDIs is found to be too high in prescriptions of consultants from 
      medicine OPD of a private hospital in Karachi. Significant drug-drug interactions 
      were more and mostly caused by Pharmacodynamic mechanism. Number wise evaluation 
      showed three common pairs of drugs involved in interactions.

TI  - An unexpected role for angiotensin II in the link between dietary salt and 
      proximal reabsorption.
PG  - 1110-6
AB  - We set out to confirm the long-held, but untested, assumption that dietary salt 
      affects proximal reabsorption through reciprocal effects on the renin-angiotensin 
      system in a way that facilitates salt homeostasis. Wistar rats were fed standard 
      or high-salt diets for 7 days and then subjected to renal micropuncture for 
      determination of single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) and proximal reabsorption. The 
      tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system was used as a tool to manipulate SNGFR in 
      order to distinguish primary changes in net proximal reabsorption (Jprox) from 
      changes due to glomerulotubular balance. The influence of Ang II over Jprox was 
      determined by the sensitivity of Jprox to the AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan. 
      Plasma, whole kidneys, and fluid from midproximal tubules were assayed for Ang II 
      content by radioimmunoassay. In rats on the standard diet, losartan reduced Jprox 
      by 25% and reduced the maximum range of the TGF response by 50%. The high-salt 
      diet suppressed plasma and whole-kidney Ang II levels. But the high-salt diet 
      failed to reduce the impact of losartan on Jprox or the TGF response and actually 
      caused tubular fluid Ang II content to increase. The persistent effect of Ang II 
      on Jprox prevented a major rise in late proximal flow rate in response to the 
      high-salt diet. These observations challenge the traditional model and indicate 
      that the role of proximal tubular Ang II in salt-replete rats is to stabilize 
      nephron function rather than to contribute to salt homeostasis.

TI  - Differential inhibition of human CYP2C8 and molecular docking interactions 
      elicited by sorafenib and its major N-oxide metabolite.

AB  - The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib (SOR) is being used increasingly in 
      combination with other anticancer agents like paclitaxel, but this increases the 
      potential for drug toxicity. SOR inhibits several human CYPs, including CYP2C8, 
      which is a major enzyme in the elimination of oncology drugs like paclitaxel and 
      imatinib. It has been reported that CYP2C8 inhibition by SOR in human liver 
      microsomes is potentiated by NADPH-dependent biotransformation. This implicates a 
      SOR metabolite in enhanced inhibition, although the identity of that metabolite 
      is presently unclear. The present study evaluated the capacity of the major 
      N-oxide metabolite of SOR (SNO) to inhibit CYP2C8-dependent paclitaxel 
      6α-hydroxylation. The IC(50) of SNO against CYP2C8 activity was found to be 
      3.7-fold lower than that for the parent drug (14 μM versus 51 μM). In molecular 
      docking studies, both SOR and SNO interacted with active site residues in CYP2C8, 
      but four additional major hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions were 
      identified between SNO and amino acids in the B-B' loop region and helixes F' and 
      I that comprise the catalytic region of the enzyme. In contrast, the binding of 
      both SOR and SNO to active site residues in the closely related human CYP2C9 
      enzyme was similar, as were the IC(50)s determined against CYP2C9-mediated 
      losartan oxidation. These findings suggest that the active metabolite SNO could 
      impair the elimination of coadministered drugs that are substrates for CYP2C8, 
      and mediate toxic adverse events, perhaps in those individuals in whom SNO is 
      formed extensively.

TI  - Lower CYP2C9 activity in Turkish patients with Behçet's disease compared to 
      healthy subjects: a down-regulation due to inflammation?
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1007/s00228-015-1899-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported on a Swedish patient with Behçet's disease 
      (BD) who was an ultra-rapid metaboliser of drugs catalysed by CYP2C9. Was this 
      extreme metabolism caused by the disease? AIM: This study aims to compare the 
      genotype/phenotype of CYP2C9 in patients with BD and healthy subjects. As the 
      occurrence of BD is high in Turkey, all subjects were recruited from this 
      country. METHODS: Genotyping of CYP2C9 was performed using standard PCR-RFLP and 
      allele-specific PCR methods. Phenotyping of CYP2C9 was performed by 
      administration of a 50-mg single oral dose of losartan and by calculating the 
      urinary metabolic ratio (MR) of probe drug to its metabolite E-3174. Quantitation 
      was performed by HPLC. RESULTS: The frequency of CYP2C9*2 and *3 was not 
      significantly different between the Behçet's disease patients (12.5 and 8.7%) and 
      the healthy subjects (8.9 and 8.2%). The geometric mean losartan MR was higher in 
      the 52 patients (1.75) than in the 96 healthy subjects (1.02) (p = 0.002; 
      t-test). Within the genotypes *1/*1, there was a significant difference of MR 
      between patients and healthy subjects (P = 0.006). All but three of the Behçet's 
      disease patients were treated with colchicine. In nine subsequent patients, we 
      found no significant effect of 2 weeks of treatment with colchicine on the CYP2C9 
      MR. CONCLUSION: Contrary to expectation, the CYP2C9 activity was lower in Turkish 
      BD patients compared to healthy subjects. As this seems not to be due to 
      colchicine treatment, our hypothesis is that inflammation related to BD might 
      have caused the down-regulation of the CYP2C9 activity due to immune cytokine 
      reactions. The ultra-rapid metabolism of CYP2C9 substrate drugs in the Swedish 
      patient was not due to her BD.

AB  - The angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), which is expressed in blood vessels of 
      the posterior eye, is of paramount significance in the pathogenesis of severe 
      ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular 
      degeneration. However, small molecule angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have 
      not proven to be a significant therapeutic success. We report here on a 
      nanoparticle system consisting of ARB molecules presented in a multivalent 
      fashion on the surface of quantum dots (Qdots). As a result of the multivalent 
      receptor binding, nanoparticles targeted cells with high AT1R expression and 
      inhibited their angiotensin receptor signaling with an IC50 of 3.8 nM while 
      showing only minor association to cells with low AT1R expression. After 
      intravenous injection into the tail vein of mice, multivalent nanoparticles 
      accumulated in retinal and choroidal blood vessels of the posterior eye. At the 
      same time, multivalent ligand display doubled the Qdot concentration in the blood 
      vessels compared to non-targeted Qdots. Remarkably, ARB-targeted Qdots showed no 
      pronounced accumulation in AT1R-expressing off-target tissues such as the kidney. 
      Following systemic application, this multivalent targeting approach has the 
      potential to amplify AT1R blockade in the eye and concomitantly deliver a 
      therapeutic payload into ocular lesions.

TI  - Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport and gene expression in congestive heart 
      failure are modified by imidapril treatment.
PG  - H1674-82
AB  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that blockade of the 
      renin-angiotensin system improves cardiac function in congestive heart failure by 
      preventing changes in gene expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins. We 
      employed rats with myocardial infarction (MI) to examine effects of an 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, imidapril, on SR Ca(2+) transport, 
      protein content, and gene expression. Imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) was given 
      for 4 wk starting 3 wk after coronary artery occlusion. Infarcted rats exhibited 
      a fourfold increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, whereas rates of 
      pressure development and decay were decreased by 60 and 55%, respectively. SR 
      Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) pump ATPase, as well as Ca(2+) release and ryanodine 
      receptor binding activities, were depressed in the failing hearts; protein 
      content and mRNA levels for Ca(2+) pump ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine 
      receptor were also decreased by approximately 55-65%. Imidapril treatment of 
      infarcted animals improved cardiac performance and attenuated alterations in SR 
      Ca(2+) pump and Ca(2+) release activities. Changes in protein content and mRNA 
      levels for SR Ca(2+) pump ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine receptor were also 
      prevented by imidapril treatment. Beneficial effects of imidapril on cardiac 
      function and SR Ca(2+) transport were not only seen at different intervals of MI 
      but were also simulated by another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
      enalapril, and an ANG II receptor antagonist, losartan. These results suggest 
      that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the abundance of mRNA 
      for SR proteins and, thus, may prevent the depression in SR Ca(2+) transport and 
      improve cardiac function in congestive heart failure due to MI.

TI  - A Drug-Drug Interaction Study Evaluating the Effect of Givosiran, a Small 
      Interfering Ribonucleic Acid, on Cytochrome P450 Activity in the Liver.
PG  - 1250-1260
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2419 [doi]
AB  - Givosiran (trade name GIVLAARI) is a small interfering ribonucleic acid that 
      targets hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) messenger RNA for 
      degradation through RNA interference (RNAi) that has been approved for the 
      treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). RNAi therapeutics, such as givosiran, 
      have a low liability for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) because they are not 
      metabolized by cytochrome 450 (CYP) enzymes, and do not directly inhibit or 
      induce CYP enzymes in the liver. The pharmacodynamic effect of givosiran 
      (lowering of hepatic ALAS1, the first and rate limiting enzyme in the heme 
      biosynthesis pathway) presents a unique scenario where givosiran could 
      potentially impact heme-dependent activities in the liver, such as CYP enzyme 
      activity. This study assessed the impact of givosiran on the pharmacokinetics of 
      substrates of 5 major CYP450 enzymes in subjects with acute intermittent 
      porphyria (AIP), the most common type of AHP, by using the validated "Inje 
      cocktail," comprised of caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole 
      (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4). We show that 
      givosiran treatment had a differential inhibitory effect on CYP450 enzymes in the 
      liver, resulting in a moderate reduction in activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, a 
      minor effect on CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and a similar weak effect on CYP2C9. To date, 
      this is the first study evaluating the DDI for an oligonucleotide therapeutic and 
      highlights an atypical drug interaction due to the pharmacological effect of 
      givosiran. The results of this study suggest that givosiran does not have a large 
      effect on heme-dependent CYP enzyme activity in the liver.

TI  - Characterization and development of angiotensin II receptor subtypes (AT1 and

PG  - R209-16
AB  - Angiotensin II receptor subtypes (AT1 and AT2) were characterized in rat brain by 
      displacement with the specific angiotensin antagonists Du Pont 753 and CGP 
      42112A, respectively, and quantitative autoradiography. Young (2-wk-old) rats 
      expressed AT1 receptors in selected limbic system areas, structures involved in 
      cardiovascular and fluid regulation, parts of the hippocampal formation, and the 
      choroid plexus. In young rats, AT2 receptors were concentrated in areas involved 
      in control and learning of motor activity, sensory areas, and selected limbic 
      system structures. The cingulate cortex, the molecular layer of the cerebellar 
      cortex, and the superior colliculus contained both AT1 and AT2 receptors. The 
      number of AT1 receptors in most areas of adult (8-wk-old) rats was similar to or 
      even higher than that present in young rats. Conversely, AT2 receptors were 
      always much lower in number in adult animals, and in some areas they were 
      undetectable in adults. Their differential localization and development suggest 
      different functions for the specific angiotensin II receptor subtypes.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of valproic acid on cytochrome P450 2C9 activity in epilepsy 
      patients.
PG  - 383-6
AB  - Drug interactions constitute a major problem in the treatment of epilepsy because 
      drug combinations are so common. Valproic acid is a widely used anticonvulsant 
      drug with a broad therapeutic spectrum. Case reports suggest interaction between 
      valproic acid and other drugs metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 isoforms. The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of valproic acid on 
      cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity by using losartan oxidation as a probe in 
      epilepsy patients. Patients were prescribed sodium valproate (mean 200 mg/day for 
      the first week and 400 mg/day in the following period) according to their 
      clinical need. A single oral dose of 25 mg losartan was given to patients before 
      and after the first dose, first week and 4 weeks of valproic acid treatment. 
      Losartan and E3174, the CYP2C9-derived carboxylic acid metabolite of losartan in 
      8 hr urine were assayed by using high pressure liquid chromatography. Urinary 
      losartan/E3174 ratio did not change significantly on the first day (0.9, 0.3-3.5; 
      median, range), and first week (0.6, 0.2-3.8; median, range), while a significant 
      increase was observed after 4 weeks of valproic acid treatment (1.1, 0.3-5.7; 
      median, range) as compared to that of measured before valproic acid 
      administration (0.6, 0.1-2.1; median, range) (P = 0.039). The degree of 
      inhibition was correlated with the steady-state plasma concentrations of valproic 
      acid (r(2) = 0.70, P = 0.04). The results suggest an inhibitory effect of 
      valproic acid on CYP2C9 enzyme activity in epilepsy patients at steady state. The 
      risk of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions should be taken into account 
      during concomitant use of valproic acid and CYP2C9 substrates.

TI  - Dose-dependent effect of angiotensin II on human erythropoietin production.
PG  - 838-44
AB  - Current evidence suggests that angiotensin II may be involved in the regulation 
      of renal erythropoietin (EPO) production. The present study assessed the role of 
      angiotensin II (A II) in different doses in the control of EPO production in 
      humans. In a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled open design, 60 healthy 
      male volunteers received a 6-h intravenous infusion of: placebo (placebo, 
      electrolyte solution), a pressor dose of A II (1-3 microg/min; A II press), a 
      combination of a pressor dose of A II and the selective AT1-receptor blocker 
      losartan, 50 mg (A II press + L), a subpressor dose of A II (0.0375-0.15 
      microg/min; A II subpress) and a combination of a subpressor dose of A II and 
      losartan (A II subpress + L). A II press treatment resulted in a significant 
      increase of the maximum EPO concentration (CmaxEPO, 41% higher versus placebo) 
      and the amount of EPO produced in 24 h (AUCEPO(0-24 h), 61% larger versus 
      placebo), A II subpress treatment increased CmaxEPO (35% higher versus placebo) 
      and AUC(EPO)(0-24 h) (34% larger versus placebo). A II press + L and A II 
      subpress + L treatments did not significantly increase CmaxEPO and AUCEPO(0-24 h) 
      compared to placebo. A II affects EPO production in a dose-dependent manner. The 
      signal seems to be mediated via AT1-receptors. A II appears to be one modulator 
      EPO production in humans.

TI  - Chronic central versus systemic blockade of AT(1) receptors and cardiac 
      dysfunction in rats post-myocardial infarction.
PG  - H968-75
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00317.2009 [doi]
AB  - In rats, both central and systemic ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade 
      attenuate sympathetic hyperactivity, but central blockade more effectively 
      attenuates left ventricular (LV) dysfunction post-myocardial infarction (MI). In 
      protocol I, we examined whether functional effects on cardiac load may play a 
      role and different cardiac effects disappear after withdrawal of the blockade. 
      Wistar rats were infused for 4 wk post-MI intracerebroventricularly (1 
      mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or injected subcutaneously daily (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) 
      with losartan. LV dimensions and function were assessed at 4 wk and at 6 wk 
      post-MI, i.e., 2 wk after discontinuing treatments. At 4 and 6 wk post-MI, LV 
      dimensions were increased and ejection fraction was decreased. 
      Intracerebroventricular but not subcutaneous losartan significantly improved 
      these parameters. At 6 wk, LV peak systolic pressure (LVPSP) and maximal or 
      minimal first derivative of change in pressure over time (dP/dt(max/min)) were 
      decreased and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was increased. All four indexes 
      were improved by previous intracerebroventricular losartan, whereas subcutaneous 
      losartan improved LVEDP only. In protocol II, we evaluated effects of oral 
      instead of subcutaneous administration of losartan for 4 wk post-MI. Losartan ( 
      approximately 200 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) either via drinking water or by gavage 
      similarly decreased AT(1) receptor binding densities in brain nuclei and improved 
      LVEDP but further decreased LVPSP and dP/dt(max). These results indicate that 
      effects on cardiac load by peripheral AT(1) receptor blockade or the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of subcutaneous versus oral dosing do not contribute to 
      the different cardiac effects of central versus systemic AT(1) receptor blockade 
      post-MI.

TI  - Receptor-mediated intrarenal angiotensin II augmentation in angiotensin 
      II-infused rats.
PG  - 669-77
AB  - Chronic low-dose angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion for 13 days mimics two-kidney, 
      one clip Goldblatt hypertension and increase intrarenal Ang II levels. We 
      performed studies to determine the time course for the enhancement of intrarenal 
      Ang II levels and whether the increased intrarenal Ang II is a tissue-specific 
      event and requires a receptor-mediated step. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      uninephrectomized, and either vehicle or Ang II (40 ng/min) was infused via a 
      subcutaneous osmotic minipump. Plasma and renal Ang II levels were measured 3, 7, 
      10, and 13 days after minipump implantation. Compared with controls (126 +/- 2 mm 
      Hg), systolic pressure in Ang II-infused rats exhibited a detectable increase by 
      day 6 (146 +/- 2 mm Hg) and continued to increase to 189 +/- 5 mm Hg by day 12. 
      Plasma Ang II levels were elevated by day 3, whereas intrarenal Ang II levels 
      were not significantly elevated until 10 days of Ang II infusion. Renal injury 
      characterized by focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis was evident after 13 days 
      of Ang II infusion. Losartan (30 mg/kg per day) prevented the development of 
      hypertension in the Ang II-infused rats for the duration of the infusion period 
      (125 +/- 1 mm Hg) and reduced the degree of glomerular injury. Plasma renin 
      activity was suppressed in the Ang II-infused group but was elevated markedly in 
      both losartan-treated groups. Plasma Ang II levels were elevated in the Ang 
      II-infused rats and were even higher during losartan treatment. Intrarenal Ang II 
      levels were enhanced significantly (354 +/- 60 versus 164 +/- 23 fmol/g) in the 
      Ang II-infused rats. However, losartan treatment prevented the augmentation of 
      intrarenal Ang II caused by Ang II infusion. Heart and adrenal Ang II levels were 
      not significantly increased in the Ang II-infused rats but were significantly 
      elevated during losartan treatment. These results suggest that the 
      tissue-specific elevations of intrarenal Ang II levels caused by chronic Ang II 
      infusion are mediated by angiotensin type 1 receptor activation, which leads to 
      either receptor-mediated internalization of Ang II, enhancement of intrarenal Ang 
      II formation, or both.

TI  - Use of a cocktail probe to assess potential drug interactions with cytochrome

PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13097 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This open-label study investigated the effect of belatacept on cytokine 
      levels and on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, 
      dextromethorphan and midazolam, as CYP probe substrates after oral administration 
      of the Inje cocktail in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-two evaluable 
      subjects received the Inje cocktail on Days 1, 4, 7 and 11 and belatacept 
      infusion on Day 4. RESULTS: Since belatacept caused no major alterations to 
      cytokine levels, there were no major effects on CYP-substrate pharmacokinetics, 
      except for a slight (16-30%) increase in omeprazole exposure, which was probably 
      due to omeprazole-mediated, time-dependent CYP inhibition. Belatacept did not 
      cause major alterations in the pharmacokinetics, as measured by the geometric 
      mean ratios and associated 90% confidence interval for area under the plasma 
      concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity on Day 7 comparing 
      administration with and without belatacept for caffeine (1.002 [0.914, 1.098]), 
      dextromethorphan (1.031 [0.885, 1.200]), losartan (1.016 [0.938, 1.101)], 
      midazolam (0.968 [0.892, 1.049]) or their respective metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Therefore, no dose adjustments of CYP substrates are indicated with belatacept 
      coadministration.

TI  - Effect of commercial Rhodiola rosea on CYP enzyme activity in humans.
PG  - 295-300
LID - 10.1007/s00228-015-1988-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the herbal 
      drug Rhodiola rosea on the activity of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A2, 
      CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in humans. METHODS: In a randomized 
      cross-over study, 13 healthy volunteers were given a cocktail with single doses 
      of the CYP substrates caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), 
      dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4) with and without 14 days of 
      pretreatment with a commercially available R. rosea product (Arctic Root, 
      produced by the Swedish Herbal Institute). Four hours after intake of the drug 
      cocktail, a blood sample was obtained, the serum concentrations of the drugs and 
      their metabolites were analyzed, and the metabolic ratios were calculated as a 
      measure of CYP enzyme activity. RESULTS: A statistically significant 21% decrease 
      in the EXP-3174/losartan ratio was found after pretreatment with R. rosea 
      (p = 0.023), indicating a reduced CYP2C9 metabolic activity. The effect was more 
      pronounced in CYP2C9 extensive metabolizers than in CYP2C9 intermediate and poor 
      metabolizers. For the other CYP enzymes tested, no significant effects were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that R. rosea inhibits the metabolic 
      capacity of CYP2C9 in humans. Although the effect is modest, it might be 
      clinically relevant during treatment with CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow 
      therapeutic index, such as phenytoin and warfarin.

AB  - A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      method for simultaneous determination of febuxostat and its three active 
      metabolites in human plasma was developed using a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (50 mm × 
      4.6 mm, 5 μm) and an optimized gradient mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, 
      water and formic acid. Plasma samples were spiked with the internal standard 
      losartan and then pre-treated using one-step protein precipitation with methanol. 
      Mass spectrometric detection was performed by selective reaction monitoring mode 
      via electrospray ionization source operating in positive ionization mode. The 
      method exhibited good linearity over the concentration range of 10-20,000 ng/mL 
      for febuxostat, 1.0-270 ng/mL for 67M-1 and 67M-2, and 0.8-250 ng/mL for 67 M-4, 
      respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 14.7% and the 
      accuracy ranged from -4.3% to 5.1%. The method was successfully applied to a 
      clinical pharmacokinetic study of febuxostat in humans after oral administration 
      of a single dose of febuxostat at 40, 80 and 120 mg.

TI  - The fraction dose absorbed, in humans, and high jejunal human permeability 
      relationship.
PG  - 1847-51
LID - 10.1021/mp300140h [doi]
AB  - The drug intestinal permeability (P(eff)) measure has been widely used as one of 
      the main factors governing both the rate and/or extent of drug absorption 
      (F(abs)) in humans following oral administration. In this communication we 
      emphasize the complexity behind and the care that must be taken with this in vivo 
      P(eff) measurement. Intestinal permeability, considering the whole of the human 
      intestine, is more complex than generally recognized, and this can lead to 
      misjudgment regarding F(abs) and P(eff) in various settings, e.g. drug discovery, 
      formulation design, drug development and regulation. Setting the adequate 
      standard for the low/high permeability class boundary, the different experimental 
      methods for the permeability measurement, and segmental-dependent permeability 
      throughout the human intestine due to different mechanisms are some of the main 
      points that are discussed. Overall, the use of jejunal P(eff) as a surrogate for 
      extent of absorption is sound and scientifically justified; a compound with high 
      jejunal P(eff) will have high F(abs), eliminating the risk for misclassification 
      as a BCS class I drug. Much more care should be taken, however, when jejunal 
      P(eff) does not support a high-permeability classification; a thorough 
      examination may reveal high-permeability after all, attributable to e.g. 
      segmental-dependent permeability due to degree of ionization or transporter 
      expression. In this situation, the use of multiple permeability experimental 
      methods, including the use of metabolism, which except for luminal degradation 
      requires absorption, is prudent and encouraged.

TI  - How can the differences among AT1-receptor antagonists be explained?
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Over the last few years we have seen a new class of antihypertensive drug evolve, 
      the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists. Hypothetically, all substances 
      in this class should have the same effect on blood pressure and on end-organ 
      damage as they all block the AT1 receptor. However, there are distinctions 
      between them that may explain the significant and clinically important 
      differences that seem to exist within this class of drug. An explanation for the 
      differences may be found in receptor-antagonist kinetics. The receptor-antagonist 
      interaction may be fitted to a two-state, two-step model which determines how 
      large a part of the binding that will be surmountable and how large a part that 
      will be insurmountable. The proportion of surmountable/insurmountable binding 
      fits nicely to the duration of binding of the antagonist to the receptor, which 
      may be translated into efficacy for the antagonist as outlined in the following 
      review.

TI  - Comparative angiotensin II receptor blockade in healthy volunteers: the 
      importance of dosing.
PG  - 68-76
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We have reported previously that 80 mg valsartan and 50 mg losartan 
      provide less receptor blockade than 150 mg irbesartan in normotensive subjects. 
      In this study we investigated the importance of drug dosing in mediating these 
      differences by comparing the AT(1)-receptor blockade induced by 3 doses of 
      valsartan with that obtained with 3 other antagonists at given doses. METHODS: 
      Valsartan (80, 160, and 320 mg), 50 mg losartan, 150 mg irbesartan, and 8 mg 
      candesartan were administered to 24 healthy subjects in a randomized, open-label, 
      3-period crossover study. All doses were given once daily for 8 days. The 
      angiotensin II receptor blockade was assessed with two techniques, the reactive 
      rise in plasma renin activity and an in vitro radioreceptor binding assay that 
      quantified the displacement of angiotensin II by the blocking agents. 
      Measurements were obtained before and 4 and 24 hours after drug intake on days 1 
      and 8. RESULTS: At 4 and 24 hours, valsartan induced a dose-dependent "blockade" 
      of AT(1) receptors. Compared with other antagonists, 80 mg valsartan and 50 mg 
      losartan had a comparable profile. The 160-mg and 320-mg doses of valsartan 
      blocked AT(1) receptors at 4 hours by 80%, which was similar to the effect of 150 
      mg irbesartan. At trough, however, the valsartan-induced blockade was slightly 
      less than that obtained with irbesartan. With use of plasma renin activity as a 
      marker of receptor blockade, on day 8, 160 mg valsartan was equivalent to 150 mg 
      irbesartan and 8 mg candesartan. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the 
      differences in angiotensin II receptor blockade observed with the various AT(1) 
      antagonists are explained mainly by differences in dosing. When 160-mg or 320-mg 
      doses were investigated, the effects of valsartan hardly differed from those 
      obtained with recommended doses of irbesartan and candesartan.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate felodipine as a potential perpetrator of pharmacokinetic 
      drug-drug interactions (PK-DDIs) involving cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp). METHODS: Felodipine extended-release 10 mg was 
      administered daily to six healthy subjects for 7 days (days 1-7). Subjects were 
      administered a modified Inje cocktail comprising the selective probe substrates 
      caffeine 100 mg (CYP1A2), losartan 25 mg (CYP2C9), omeprazole 20 mg (CYP2C19), 
      dextromethorphan 30 mg (CYP2D6), midazolam 2 mg (CYP3A) and digoxin 250 μg (P-gp) 
      on day 0 (prior to felodipine exposure) and day 7 (after felodipine exposure). 
      Plasma samples were collected over 24 h and drug concentrations measured by 
      UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The geometric means of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve ratios (probe AUC after felodipine exposure/probe AUC 
      prior to felodipine exposure) and 95% confidence intervals for each probe were: 
      caffeine 0.91 (0.64-1.30), losartan 1.05 (0.95-1.15), omeprazole 1.17 
      (0.78-1.76), dextromethorphan 1.46 (1.00-2.12), midazolam 1.23 (0.99-1.52) and 
      digoxin 1.01 (0.89-1.15). CONCLUSION: Felodipine may be a weak in vivo inhibitor 
      of CYP3A and CYP2D6 but is unlikely to act as a significant perpetrator of 
      PK-DDIs.

      losartan, omeprazole, debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine), and quinine can be given 
      simultaneously in low doses as a cocktail for the phenotyping of cytochrome P450 
      (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, respectively, and (2) to design an 
      administration schedule to give as few sampling occasions as possible. METHODS: 
      Twenty-four subjects were given oral doses of 100 mg caffeine, 25 mg losartan, 20 
      mg omeprazole, 10 mg debrisoquin, and 250 mg quinine on separate days. After a 
      washout period of at least 4 days, all drugs were given simultaneously except for 
      quinine, which was given 8 hours after the other drugs. Blood and urine samples 
      were collected to determine parent drug and metabolite concentrations for 
      assessment of phenotyping indices. Any difference between both single and 
      cocktail doses was tested on a log-normal distribution. RESULTS: The phenotypic 
      indices of CYP1A2 (paraxanthine/caffeine in 4-hour plasma), CYP2C9 
      (losartan/E-3174 [metabolite of losartan] in 0- to 8-hour urine), CYP2C19 
      (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole in 3-hour plasma), and CYP3A4 
      (quinine/3-hydroxyquinine in 16-hour plasma) were not significantly changed when 
      probe drugs were administered alone compared with together, although a tendency 
      toward higher concentrations of losartan was seen during simultaneous 
      administration (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.002; P =.051). The CYP2D6 
      phenotypic index (debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin in 0- to 8-hour urine) was 
      significantly changed when drugs were given together (95% confidence interval, 
      0.45-0.87; P =.007), indicating an inhibition of the debrisoquin metabolism. The 
      within-subject coefficients of variation (8%-25%) were much lower than the 
      between-subject coefficients of variation (34%-79%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      administration of drugs together suggests an inhibition of debrisoquin metabolism 
      caused by the concurrent drugs given. By separating debrisoquin from the other 
      cocktail drugs, this method is likely to be used as a tool to phenotype the 
      enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 with only 2 urinary 
      collections and 2 blood-sampling occasions.

TI  - Disposition of a CYP2C9 phenotyping agent, losartan, is not influenced by the 
      common 3435C > T variation of the drug transporter gene ABCB1 (MDR1).
PG  - 176-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2008.00283.x [doi]
AB  - Losartan is oxidized to E3174 by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9); it has been 
      suggested as a useful probe drug for CYP2C9 activity. It has also been shown to 
      be a substrate for the drug-efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette sub-family B 
      member 1 (ABCB1, MDR1). Both CYP2C9 and ABCB1 genes are polymorphic. The aim of 
      the study was to determine if losartan disposition was influenced by the 3435C > 
      T polymorphism of ABCB1 in healthy persons. These participants (n = 58) whose 
      CYP2C9 genotypes and phenotypes were determined previously were genotyped for 
      3435C > T polymorphism in ABCB1. The concentrations of losartan and E3174 were 
      compared across genotypes for ABCB1 3435C > T variation. For persons with the 
      ABCB1 3435 CC, CT, TT genotypes, the concentrations (microM, means +/- S.D.) of 
      neither losartan (1.76 +/- 0.87, 1.68 +/- 0.84 and 1.80 +/- 0.85, respectively, P 
      = 0.70) nor E3174 (2.97 +/- 2.49, 2.53 +/- 2.09 and 3.18 +/- 2.75, respectively, 
      P = 0.65) were significantly different. These results suggest that ABCB1 3435C > 
      T polymorphism does not have any influence on losartan disposition. Therefore, 
      ABCB1 3435C > T polymorphism is probably not a confounding factor in the 
      prediction of CYP2C9 activity by using losartan as a probe agent.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren in combination

      clinical experience of 12,942 patients.
PG  - 506-16

AB  - Combinations of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren with angiotensin receptor 
      blockers (ARBs) or diuretics are effective therapeutic regimens for the treatment 
      of hypertension. A large database of safety information has become available 
      during the past several years with aliskiren in combination trials. Data were 
      pooled from 9 short-term (8-week) and 4 longer-term (26- to 52-week) randomized 
      controlled trials of aliskiren in patients with hypertension. Adverse event (AE) 
      rates were assessed for aliskiren combination therapy compared with component 
      monotherapies. In short-term studies, overall AE rates were similar for patients 
      receiving aliskiren/valsartan or aliskiren/diuretic combinations (32.2%-39.8%) 
      and those receiving the component monotherapies (30.0%-39.6%). In longer-term 
      studies, AE rates with aliskiren/losartan (55.5%) and aliskiren/diuretic (45.0%) 
      combination therapy were similar to those with losartan (53.9%) and diuretic 
      (48.9%) alone. Angioedema and hyperkalemia occurred in similar proportions of 
      patients taking combination therapies vs monotherapy. The safety and tolerability 
      profile of aliskiren in combination with the ARBs valsartan or losartan, or 
      diuretic, is similar to aliskiren, ARBs, or diuretics alone.

TI  - Impact of the Commercialization of Three Generic Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers 
      on Adverse Events in Quebec, Canada: A Population-Based Time Series Analysis.
LID - e003891 [pii]
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.117.003891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Once the patent of a brand-name drug expires, generic drugs are 
      commercialized, and substitution from brand-name to generics may occur. Generic 
      drug equivalence is evaluated through comparative bioavailability studies. Few 
      studies have assessed outcomes after generic drug commercialization at a 
      population level. We evaluated the impact of 3 generic angiotensin II receptor 
      blockers commercialization on adverse events: hospitalizations or emergency room 
      consultations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is an interrupted time series analysis 
      using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System. Rates of adverse 
      events for losartan, valsartan, and candesartan users (N=136 177) aged ≥66 years 
      were calculated monthly, 24 months before and 12 months after generics 
      commercialization. Periods before and after generics commercialization were 
      compared by negative binomial segmented regression models. Sensitivity analyses 
      were also conducted. For all users, there was a monthly mean rate of 100 adverse 
      events for 1000 angiotensin II receptor blocker users before and after generic 
      commercialization. Among generic users of losartan, valsartan, and candesartan, 
      there was an increase in rates of adverse events of 8.0% (difference of 
      proportions versus brand-name, 7.5% [95% confidence interval, -0.9% to 15.9%]; 
      P=0.0643), 11.7% (difference of proportions, 17.1% [95% confidence interval, 
      9.9%-24.3%]; P<0.0001), and 14.0% (difference of proportions, 16.6% [95% 
      confidence interval, 7.9%-25.3%]; P<0.0001), respectively, the month of generic 
      commercialization. The monthly trend of adverse events was affected for generic 
      versus brand-name losartan users only (difference of proportions, 2.0% 
      [0.7%-3.4%]; P=0.0033) ≤1 year after generics commercialization. Similar results 
      were found in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Among generic users, immediate 
      or delayed differences in adverse events rates were observed right after generic 
      commercialization for 3 antihypertensive drugs. Rates of adverse events remained 
      higher for generic users. Increases were more pronounced for generic candesartan, 
      which is the studied product with the largest difference in comparative 
      bioavailability. Risk and survival analysis studies controlling for several 
      potential confounding factors are required to better characterize generic 
      substitution.

TI  - Effects of losartan on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in mice.
PG  - 1045-7
AB  - Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy remains a useful method to study central 
      dopaminergic function in rodents. Evidence obtained in several studies indicates 
      that this phenomenon can be modified by cholinergic, histaminergic and 
      serotonergic manipulation. Angiotensin II is a central neurotransmitter acting 
      through AT1 and AT2 receptors. There are few data on the effect of 
      angiotensinergic drugs on dopaminergic transmission. We investigated the effect 
      of losartan, a nonpeptide antagonist of central and peripheral AT1 receptors, on 
      neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Adult male albino mice, 26-35 g, were used. 
      Catalepsy was induced with haloperidol (H; 1 mg/kg, ip) and measured at 30-min 
      intervals by means of a bar test. Losartan (10 or 100 ng/kg) or saline (control; 
      0.13 ml) was injected intraperitoneally 20 min before H, with each animal (7 per 
      group) being used only once. Losartan (10 and 100 ng/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) 
      potentiated the cataleptic effect of H in comparison to the control group (e.g. 
      264 +/- 26 and 299 +/- 68 sec, respectively, vs 89 +/- 24 sec for the control 
      group, 90 min after H). No differences were demonstrable 120, 150 or 180 min 
      after H. Considering the high selectivity and the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      losartan, these data suggest that central angiotensin AT1 receptors play a role 
      in neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. However, further studies are necessary to 
      confirm this hypothesis and to clarify the mechanism(s) involved in this process.

TI  - Can the CEIBA Cocktail Designed for Human Cytochrome P450 Enzymes be Used in the 
      Rat for Drug Interaction Studies?
PG  - 520-529
LID - 10.18433/J3D313 [doi]
AB  - Purpose - The CEIBA cocktail consisting of caffeine (CAF), omeprazole (OZ), 
      dextromethorphan (DM) and losartan (LOS) was previously proposed for the clinical 
      phenotyping of five major human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. This work aimed 
      to assess the usefulness of CEIBA cocktail to study non-clinical drug 
      interactions in the rat. Methods - Wistar rats were divided into five groups to 
      receive a single-oral dose of each probe drug (CAF, OZ, LOS, DM), individually or 
      in combination as a cocktail. Plasma concentrations of the probe drugs and their 
      metabolites [paraxanthine (1,7-X), 5-hydroxyomeprazole (5-OZ), losartan 
      carboxylic acid (E-3174), dextrorphan (DX) and 3-methoxymorphinan (3-MM)] were 
      determined by LC-MS/MS, and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      estimated by non-compartmental analysis. The AUC0-t and Cmax drug/metabolite 
      ratios (phenotypic metrics) were calculated for each probe drug and compared 
      (probe alone versus cocktail). Results - The primary analysis of the 
      pharmacokinetic data suggested the occurrence of pharmacokinetic-based drug 
      interactions when the probe drugs were concurrently administered; such 
      interactions were documented for CAF, 1,7-X, DX and E-3174. Nevertheless, except 
      for the LOS/E-3174 probe drug-metabolite pair (p<0.05), there was little evidence 
      that the probe drugs interacted metabolically as the metabolic ratios calculated 
      were similar in both approaches. Moreover, no evidence was found for relevant 
      pharmacodynamic interactions. Conclusion - CEIBA cocktail seems to be a useful 
      tool to investigate drug interactions involving CYP isoenzymes in the rat, 
      particularly at the level of CYP1A2, CYP2D1/2 and CYP2D2 isoforms using the 
      CAF/1,7-X, OZ/5-OZ and DM/DX metabolic ratios, respectively. This article is open

TI  - Peptide and nonpeptide antagonist interaction with constitutively active human 
      AT1 receptors.
PG  - 1329-38
AB  - Wild type human AT(1) receptors (WT-AT(1)) and mutant receptors, in which 
      Asn(111) was replaced by glycine (N111G), alanine (N111A) and serine (N111S), or 
      in which Asp(281) was replaced by alanine (D281A) or in which N111G and D281A 
      replacements were combined, were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells. While the 
      biphenyltetrazole compound candesartan dissociated slowly and behaved as an 
      insurmountable antagonist for WT-AT(1), it dissociated swiftly and only produced 
      a rightward shift of the angiotensin Ang II- and -IV dose-response curves for 
      inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in cells expressing N111G. [3H]candesartan 
      competition binding yielded the same potency order of the related 
      biphenyltetrazoles for WT-AT(1) and mutated receptors, i.e. 
      candesartan>EXP3174>irbesartan>losartan. Affinities were equal for WT-AT(1) and 
      D281A and 40- to 400-fold lower for all Asn(111) mutants. Mutations did not 
      affect the affinity of the peptide antagonist [Sar(1)Ile(8)]Ang II (SARILE). 
      Basal IP accumulation in cells with WT-AT(1) was not affected by any 
      biphenyltetrazole antagonists and was increased by SARILE to 19% of the maximal 
      Ang II stimulation. Basal IP accumulation was higher for cells expressing the 
      Asn(111)-mutated receptors. For N111G, this accumulation was partially inhibited 
      by all the biphenyltetrazoles upon long-term (18hr) exposure. In these cells 
      SARILE produced the same maximal stimulation as Ang II. Asn(111)-mutated AT(1) 
      receptors are thought to mimic the pre-activated state of the wild type receptor 
      and comparing the efficacy and affinity of ligands for such mutated receptors 
      facilitate the distinction of partial (SARILE) and inverse (biphenyltetrazoles) 
      agonists from true antagonists.

TI  - A long-lasting oral preformulation of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist 
      losartan.
PG  - 1498-1505
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2018.1467923 [doi]
AB  - Losartan (Los), a non-peptidic orally active agent, reduces arterial pressure 
      through specific and selective blockade of angiotensin II receptor AT1. However, 
      this widely used AT1 antagonist presents low bioavailability and needs once or 
      twice a day dosage. In order to improve its bioavailability, we used the host: 
      guest strategy based on β-cyclodextrin (βCD). The results suggest that Los 
      included in βCD showed a typical pulsatile release pattern after oral 
      administration to rats, with increasing the levels of plasma of Los. In addition, 
      the inclusion compound presented oral efficacy for 72 h, in contrast to Los 
      alone, which shows antagonist effect for only 6 h. In transgenic (mREN2)L27 rats, 
      the Los/βCD complex reduced blood pressure for about 6 d, whereas Los alone 
      reduced blood pressure for only 2 d. More importantly, using this host: guest 
      strategy, sustained release of Los for over a week via the oral route can be 
      achieved without the need for encapsulation in a polymeric carrier. The proposed 
      preformulation increased the efficacy reducing the dose or spacing between each 
      dose intake.

TI  - Role of interleukin-6 in cardiomyocyte/cardiac fibroblast interactions during 
      myocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast proliferation.
PG  - 428-36
AB  - The process of cardiac hypertrophy is considered to involve two components: that 
      of cardiac myocyte (CM) enlargement and cardiac fibroblast (CF) proliferation. 
      The interleukin-6 (IL-6) family cytokines have been implicated in a variety of 
      cellular and molecular interactions between myocytes and non-myocytes (NCMs), 
      which in turn have important roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. In 
      the study of these interactions, we previously detected very high levels of IL-6 
      in supernatants of a "dedifferentiated model" of adult ventricular CMs cultured 
      with CFs. In the present study, we have used this in vitro coculture system to 
      examine how IL-6 is involved in the interactions between CMs and CFs during CM 
      hypertrophy and CF proliferation. IL-6 and its signal transducer, 130-kDa 
      glycoprotein (gp130), were detected by immunostaining cultured CMs and CFs with 
      anti-IL-6 or anti-gp130 antibodies. Addition of anti-IL-6 or anti-gp130 
      antagonist antibodies into CM/CF cocultures induced a significant decrease in 
      expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and beta-myosin heavy chain 
      (beta-MHC) in CMs. The presence of IL-6 antagonist also resulted in a decrease in 
      the surface area of 12-day-old CMs cultured with CFs or in the presence of 
      fibroblast conditioned medium (FCM), and decreased fibroblast proliferation in 
      CM/CF cocultures, particularly in the presence of a gp130 antagonist. The results 
      also show that angiotensin II (AngII) is mainly secreted by CFs and induces IL-6 
      secretion in CMs cultured with CFs or with FCM. In addition, the effects of IL-6 
      on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast proliferation were inhibited by 
      addition of the AT-1 receptor antagonist, losartan. These results suggest that 
      IL-6 contributes significantly to CM hypertrophy by an autocrine pathway and to 
      fibroblast proliferation by a paracrine pathway and that these effects could be 
      mediated by AngII.

TI  - High Tumor Penetration of Paclitaxel Loaded pH Sensitive Cleavable Liposomes by 
      Depletion of Tumor Collagen I in Breast Cancer.
PG  - 9691-701
LID - 10.1021/acsami.5b01473 [doi]
AB  - The network of collagen I in tumors could prevent the penetration of drugs loaded 
      in nanoparticles, and this would lead to impaired antitumor efficacy. In this 
      study, free losartan (an angiotensin inhibitor) was injected before treatment to 
      reduce the level of collagen I, which could facilitate the penetration of 
      nanoparticles. Then the pH-sensitive cleavable liposomes (Cl-Lip) were injected 
      subsequently to exert the antitumor effect. The Cl-Lip was constituted by 
      PEG(5K)-Hydrazone-PE and DSPE-PEG(2K)-R8. When the Cl-Lip reached to the tumor 
      site by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, 
      PEG(5K)-Hydrazone-PE was hydrolyzed from the Cl-Lip under the low extra-cellular 
      pH conditions of tumors, then the R8 peptide was exposed, and finally liposomes 
      could be internalized into tumor cells by the mediation of R8 peptide. In vitro 
      experiments showed both the cellular uptake of Cl-Lip by 4T1 cells and 
      cytotoxicity of paclitaxel loaded Cl-Lip (PTX-Cl-Lip) were pH sensitive. In vivo 
      experiments showed the Cl-Lip had a good tumor targeting ability. After depletion 
      of collagen I, Cl-Lip could penetrate into the deep place of tumors, the tumor 
      accumulation of Cl-Lip was further increased by 22.0%, and the oxygen distributed 
      in tumor tissues was also enhanced. The antitumor study indicated free losartan 
      in combination with PTX-Cl-Lip (59.8%) was more effective than injection with 
      PTX-Cl-Lip only (37.8%) in 4T1 tumor bearing mice. All results suggested that 
      depletion of collagen I by losartan dramatically increased the penetration of 
      PTX-Cl-Lip and combination of free losartan and PTX-CL-Lip could lead to better 
      antitumor efficacy of chemical drugs. Thus, the combination strategy might be a 
      promising tactic for better treatment of solid tumors with a high level of 
      collagen I.

TI  - AT1 receptor characteristics of angiotensin analogue binding in human synovium.
PG  - 435-42
AB  - 1. Angiotensin II (AII) reduces blood flow, modulates vascular remodelling and is 
      a growth factor. Human inflammatory arthritides are characterized by synovial 
      hypoperfusion, hypoxia and proliferation. We aimed to localize and characterize 
      receptors for AII in human synovium. 2. We used quantitative in vitro receptor 
      autoradiography with [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII and [125I]-AII on human synovium from 
      patients with chondromalacia patellae, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
      3. [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII and [125I]-AII bound to similar sites on synovial blood 
      vessels, lining cells and stroma. Binding to microvessels (< 100 microns 
      diameter) was more dense than to arteriolar media, and vascular binding was more 
      dense than that to lining cells and stroma. 4. Microvessels and arterioles which 
      displayed angiotensin converting enzyme-like immunoreactivity also displayed 
      specific binding of [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII. 5. Specific binding of [125I]-(Sar1, 
      Ile8)AII to each structure was completely inhibited by 10 microM dithiothreitol 
      and was inhibited by unlabelled ligands with the rank order of potency (Sar1, 
      Ile8)AII > AII > losartan = SKF108566 > PD123319 indicating an AT1 subclass of 
      angiotensin receptor. 6. GTP gamma S (1 microM) abolished specific binding of 
      [125I]-AII and abolished the high affinity component of the binding inhibition 
      curve for AII against [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII, indicating G protein coupling. 7. 
      The distribution of [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII binding sites was similar in all 
      disease groups and no significant differences in binding densities, affinities or 
      specificities were observed between disease groups. 8. Locally generated AII may 
      act on synovial AT1 receptors to modulate synovial perfusion and growth. Specific 
      AT1 receptor antagonists should help elucidate the role of angiotensins in human 
      arthritis.

TI  - AT(1) receptor inhibition does not reduce arterial wall hypertrophy or PDGF-A 
      expression in renal hypertension.
PG  - H613-22
AB  - To separate the role of ANG II from pressure in hypertrophy of the vascular wall 
      in one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) hypertension, experimental and sham-operated rats 
      were given the AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan (20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or 
      tap water for 14 days. Mean arterial pressure was elevated in both experimental 
      groups compared with controls. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, 
      and the thoracic aorta and carotid, small mesenteric, and external spermatic 
      arteries were harvested and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were used for 
      morphological analysis, immunohistochemistry for 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 
      and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, stereological measurements, and in 
      situ hybridization with a (35)S-labeled riboprobe for PDGF-A mRNA. Elevated 
      cross-sectional areas of thoracic, carotid, and small mesenteric artery in 1K1C 
      rats were not reduced by losartan. The internal diameter of the external 
      spermatic artery and microvascular density of the cremaster muscle were reduced 
      in 1K1C rats. The number of BrdU-positive nuclei per cross section did not differ 
      between 1K1C and control arteries. PDGF-A mRNA was elevated in the arterial walls 
      of 1K1C rats compared with controls and was hardly changed by losartan. PDGF-A 
      protein stained strongly in the media of 1K1C arteries and was not inhibited by 
      losartan; it appeared in the adventitia of all aortas and carotid arteries. These 
      observations demonstrate that effects of ANG II mediated through the AT(1) 
      receptor are not necessary for hypertrophy of the vascular wall during 1K1C 
      hypertension or expression of PDGF-A.

TI  - Prediction of the effects of genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of 
      CYP2C9 substrates from in vitro data.
PG  - 822-35
LID - 10.1007/s11095-008-9781-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The *2 and *3 alleles of CYP2C9, with decreased enzymatic activity, are 
      highly polymorphic and contribute to inter-individual differences in 
      pharmacotherapy of CYP2C9 substrates. Here, we sought for a simplified 
      theoretical method to predict the pharmacokinetic changes with minimal in vivo 
      data. METHODS: The changes in clearances of CYP2C9 substrates in subjects with 
      these alleles were quantitatively estimated by parameters from literature data: 
      intrinsic metabolic clearance and the enzyme expression level of mutated CYP2C9, 
      contribution of CYP2C9 to the CYP-mediated clearance (f (m2C9)), and the 
      contribution of the dominant metabolic pathways to the total clearance (f (h)). 
      To validate the accuracy of our prediction, the changes were compared to reported 
      in vivo values. RESULTS: Sufficient data were available for nine substrates: 
      celecoxib, diclofenac, S-flurbiprofen, losartan, S-phenprocoumon, phenytoin, 
      tolbutamide, torsemide, and S-warfarin. These predicted values, either using the 
      intrinsic clearance specific to each substrate, or the averaged values (*2: 0.66, 
      *3: 0.13, (ratio to *1)), correlated well with observed values (r (2) = 0.812, 
      0.786, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical method well estimated the 
      quantitative changes in pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 substrates in subjects with 
      mutated alleles of CYP2C9. This can be applied to drug development even from the 
      early clinical phases.

TI  - ANG II increases 2-deoxyglucose uptake in mouse embryonic stem cells.
PG  - 1916-33
AB  - It is now suggested that all components of the renin-angiotensin system are 
      present in many tissues, including the embryo and may play a major role in embryo 
      development and differentiation. However, little is known regarding whether ANG 
      II regulates glucose transport in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Thus, the 
      effects of ANG II on [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake and its related signal 
      pathways were examined in mouse ES cells. ANG II significantly increased cell 
      proliferation and 2-DG uptake in concentration- and time-dependent manner (>18 h, 
      >10(-8) M) and increased mRNA and protein level of GLUT1 by 31+/-7% and 22+/-5% 
      compared to control, respectively. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide completely 
      blocked the effect of ANG II on 2-DG uptake. ANG II-induced increase of 2-DG 
      uptake was blocked by losartan, an ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, but not 
      by PD 123319, an ANG II type 2 (AT2) receptor blocker. In addition, ANG 
      II-induced stimulation of 2-DG uptake was attenuated by phospholipase C (PLC) 
      inhibitors, neomycin and U 73122 and ANG II increased inositol phosphates (IPs) 
      formation by 37+/-8% of control. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, 
      staurosporine, bisindolylmaleimide I, and H-7 also blocked ANG II-induced 
      stimulation of 2-DG uptake. Indeed, ANG II activated a PKC translocation from the 
      cytosolic to membrane fraction, suggesting a role of PKC. A 23187 (Ca2+ 
      ionophore) increased 2-DG uptake and nifedifine (L-type Ca2+ channel blocker) 
      blocked it. In conclusion, ANG II increased 2-DG uptake by PKC activation via AT1 
      receptor in mouse ES cells.

TI  - The mechanism of improved sodium homeostasis of low-dose losartan in preascitic 
      cirrhosis.
PG  - 1449-58
AB  - Renal sodium retention on standing is one aspect of the abnormal renal sodium 
      handling in preascitic, well-compensated patients with cirrhosis. Recently, it 
      has been shown that low doses (7.5 mg) of the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor 
      antagonist, losartan, can reverse renal sodium retention on high, 200-mmol 
      sodium/d diet in these patients and restore them to sodium balance. Therefore, 
      the effect of 7.5 mg of losartan on sodium excretion, when changing from supine 
      to erect posture for 2 hours, was examined in 10 well-compensated patients with 
      cirrhosis and 9 age- and sex-matched controls on the same sodium diet, under 
      strictly controlled metabolic conditions. In contrast to control subjects, in 
      whom sodium excretion was unaffected, single 7.5-mg doses of losartan again 
      restored the preascitic patients with cirrhosis to sodium balance. In addition, 
      it blunted the fall in erect posture- induced renal sodium excretion by a 
      reduction in proximal and distal tubular reabsorption of sodium. These changes 
      occurred without any significant changes in blood volumes, systemic and renal 
      hemodynamics, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtered sodium load 
      compared with controls, and despite activation of the systemic 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which was still within normal levels. In 
      conclusion, the beneficial natriuretic effects of low-dose losartan on erect 
      posture - induced sodium retention in preascitic cirrhosis supports the 
      suggestion that the pathophysiology of sodium retention in preascites is in part 
      caused by an intrarenal tubular effect of Ang II in that posture.

TI  - Chronological effects of rifampicin discontinuation on cytochrome P450 activity 
      in healthy Japanese volunteers, using the cocktail method.
PG  - 702-8
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2013.167 [doi]
AB  - Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A are major factors 
      involved in the metabolism of clinically prescribed drugs. Because the time 
      course after drug treatment discontinuation has received little attention, we 
      aimed to clarify the chronological changes of rifampicin-induced CYP enzyme 
      activities after rifampicin discontinuation. Thirteen volunteers took 450 mg of 
      rifampicin once daily, and the cocktail method, which uses caffeine, losartan, 
      omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and midazolam as CYP-specific probes, was 
      repeatedly used for the evaluation of CYP levels. Concentrations of probes and 
      metabolites were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      Seven-day rifampicin administration increased CYP2C19 and CYP3A enzyme 
      activities. The induced CYP2C19 and CYP3A activities remained elevated at 4 days 
      after rifampicin discontinuation and returned to baseline levels 8 days after 
      rifampicin discontinuation. CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzyme activities showed no 
      significant changes, and CYP2C9 enzyme activity was increased with rifampicin 
      administration, with a tendency toward statistical significance. Drug 
      interactions can occur even after rifampicin discontinuation.

AB  - Sustained release (SR) tablets containing solid dispersions (SD) granules of a 
      poorly water-soluble drug were prepared to investigate the controlled 
      pH-independent release of the drug. Losartan potassium (LST), an 
      anti-hypertensive agent was chosen as a model drug because of its pH-dependent 
      solubility and short elimination half-life. Poloxamer 188 was used as an SD 
      carrier. A free-flowing SD granule was prepared by adsorbing the melt of the drug 
      and poloxamer 188 onto the surface of an adsorbent, Aerosil 300 (fumed silicon 
      dioxide), followed by direct compression with polyethylene oxide (PEO, 5 × 10(6)) 
      to obtain an SD-loaded SR (SD-SR) matrix tablet. Differential scanning 
      calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed partially 
      amorphous structures of the drug in the SD granules. Scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images indicated adsorption 
      of SD granules onto the surface of the adsorbent. The SD granules dissolved 
      completely within 10 min, a dissolution rate much higher than that of pure LST. 
      Moreover, pH-independent sustained release of LST from the SD-SR tablet was 
      achieved for 2h in gastric fluid (pH 1.2) and for 10h in intestinal fluid (pH 
      6.8). A combination of SD techniques using surface adsorption and SR concepts is 
      a promising approach to control the release rate of poorly water-soluble drugs in 
      a pH-independent manner.

TI  - Angiotensin II-dependent increased expression of Na+-glucose cotransporter in 
      hypertension.
PG  - F127-33
AB  - Glucose uptake is increased in hypertension. Thus we investigated Na+-glucose 
      cotransporter (SGLT2) activity and expression in proximal tubules from 
      renovascular hypertensive rats. Sham-operated rats, aortic coarctation rats, and 
      aortic coarctation rats treated with either ramipril (2.5 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 21 
      days) or losartan (10 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 21 days) were used. Na+-dependent glucose 
      uptake was measured in brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV). Vmax in BBMV from 
      hypertensive rats was greater compared with those from normotensive rats (3 +/- 
      0.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1) without a change in Km. Renal 
      immunostaining was greater, and Western blot analysis and RT-PCR showed a higher 
      expression of SGLT2 in hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats (1,029 +/- 71 
      vs. 5,003 +/- 292, 199 +/- 15 vs. 95 +/- 10, and 1.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1 
      arbitrary units, respectively). In rats treated with either ramipril or losartan, 
      Vmax decreased to 2.1 +/- 0.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.4 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1, 
      respectively, as well as did the intensity of immunostaining and levels of 
      protein and mRNA. We suggest that in renovascular hypertension, angiotensin II 
      induced SGLT2 via the AT1 receptor, which was evidenced at both the functional 
      and expression levels, probably contributing to increased absorption of Na+ and 
      thereby to the development or maintenance of hypertension.

TI  - V1/V2 Vasopressin receptor antagonism potentiates the renoprotection of 
      renin-angiotensin system inhibition in rats with renal mass reduction.
PG  - 960-7
LID - 10.1038/ki.2009.267 [doi]
AB  - Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the standard treatment for 
      chronic proteinuric nephropathy, slows but may not halt progression of the 
      disease, particularly when therapy is started late. Because vasopressin may also 
      play a role in the progression of renal disease, we measured the effect of a dual 
      V(1a) and V(2) vasopressin receptor antagonist (RWJ-676070) alone or combined 
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type 1 receptor 
      blockade on proteinuria and renal disease progression during overt nephropathy. 
      Twenty-one days after renal mass reduction, a time of established injury, rats 
      were given vehicle, RWJ-676070, enalapril, losartan, RWJ-676070 plus enalapril, 
      or losartan in drinking water for an additional 39 days. RWJ-676070 returned the 
      blood pressure to pre-treatment levels, which were significantly lower than those 
      in vehicle-treated rats. Enalapril, losartan, and the combined therapies reduced 
      blood pressure to a greater extent. RWJ-676070 afforded a partial antiproteinuric 
      effect, which was enhanced by the addition of enalapril or losartan. Renal 
      functional impairment, and glomerular and tubular changes were partially 
      ameliorated by RWJ-676070; parameters significantly improved with either 
      enalapril or losartan alone and improved to a greater extent with the combined 
      therapies. Our findings suggest that vasopressin receptor antagonists could be of 
      additional therapeutic value in the treatment of chronic proteinuric nephropathy.

AB  - Highly soluble drugs tend to release from preparations at high speeds, which make 
      them need to be taken at frequent intervals. Additionally, some drugs need to be 
      controlled to release in vivo at certain periods, so as to achieve therapeutic 
      effects. Thus, the objective of this study is to design injectable 
      microparticulate systems with controllable in vivo release profile. Biodegradable 
      PLGA was used as the matrix material to fabricate microspheres using the 
      traditional double emulsification-solvent evaporation method as well as improved 
      techniques, with gel (5% gelatine or 25% F127) or LP powders as the inner phases. 
      Their physicochemical properties were systemically investigated. Microspheres 
      prepared by modified methods had an increase in drug loading (15.50, 16.72, 
      15.66%, respectively) and encapsulation efficiencies (73.46, 79.42, 74.40%, 
      respectively) when compared with traditional methods (12.01 and 57.06%). The 
      morphology of the particles was characterized by optical microscope (OM) and 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the amorphous nature of the encapsulated 
      drug was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray 
      diffraction (XRD) analysis. To evaluate their release behaviour, the in vitro 
      degradation, in vitro release and in vivo pharmacodynamics were subsequently 
      studied. Traditional microspheres prepared in this study with water as the inner 
      phase had a relatively short release period within 16 d when compared with 
      modified microspheres with 5% gelatine as the inner phase, which resulted in a 
      smooth release profile and appropriate plasma LP concentrations over 21 d. Thus 
      this type of modified microspheres can be better used in drugs requiring 
      sustained release. The other two formulations containing 25% F127 and LP 
      micropowders presented two-stage release profiles, resulting in fluctuant plasma 
      LP concentrations which may be suitable for drugs requiring controlled release. 
      All the results suggested that drug release rates from the microspheres prepared 
      by various methods were mainly controlled by either the porosity inside the 
      microspheres or the degradation of materials, which could, therefore, lead to 
      different release behaviours. This results indicated great potential of the PLGA 
      microsphere formulation as an injectable depot for controllable in vivo release 
      profile via rational core phase design. Core/shell microspheres fabricated by 
      modified double emulsification-solvent evaporation methods, with various inner 
      phases, to obtain high loading drugs system, as well as appropriate release 
      behaviours. Accordingly, control in vivo release profile via rational core phase 
      design.

TI  - Tamoxifen inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 activity in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 421-4
AB  - Tamoxifen has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin 
      and also to increase the plasma level of phenytoin, which are mainly metabolized 
      by CYP2C9. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of tamoxifen on 
      CYP2C9 activity in vivo in humans. Thirteen breast cancer patients who would 
      start tamoxifen following cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. A 
      single oral dose of 25 mg losartan was given to the patients 2 days before and 2 
      weeks after starting tamoxifen therapy. Losartan and E3174 in 8-hour urine 
      samples were measured by HPLC. Tamoxifen significantly increased the average 
      urinary losartan/E3174 ratio from 0.73 (CI 95% = 0.15 - 2.30) to 1.66 (CI 95% = 
      0.68 - 5.20), after 2 weeks of treatment (p = 0.002). Tamoxifen inhibited CYP2C9 
      activity in breast cancer patients within two weeks of its administration. The 
      inhibition of CYP2C9 activity may be a possible explanation for the drug-drug 
      interaction of tamoxifen with CYP2C9 substrates.

TI  - Effect of 36 CYP2C9 variants found in the Chinese population on losartan 
      metabolism in vitro.
PG  - 270-5
LID - 10.3109/00498254.2013.820007 [doi]
AB  - Abstract 1.  CYP2C9 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme 
      superfamily, with 57 CYP2C9 allelic variants being previously reported. Among 
      these variants, we recently identified 21 novel alleles (*36-*56) in the Han 
      Chinese population. The aim of this study was to assess the catalytic activities 
      of 36 CYP2C9 variants found in the Chinese population toward losartan in vitro. 
      2.  Insect microsomes expressing the 36 CYP2C9 variants were incubated with 
      0.5-25 μM losartan for 30 min at 37 °C. Next, the products were extracted, and 
      signal detection was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. 3.  
      Compared with wild-type CYP2C9.1, the intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) values of all 
      variants except for CYP2C9.56 were significantly altered. One variant exhibited 
      markedly increased values (>250%), whereas 33 variants exhibited significantly 
      decreased values (from 20 to 96%) due to increased Km and/or decreased Vmax 
      values. 4.  These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to subjects 
      carrying these infrequent CYP2C9 alleles when administering losartan in the 
      clinic.

TI  - Comparative effect of ace inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor 
      antagonism on bioavailability of nitric oxide in patients with coronary artery 
      disease: role of superoxide dismutase.
PG  - 799-805
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated vasodilation (FDD) and activity 
      of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), the major antioxidative enzyme of 
      the arterial wall, are severely impaired in patients with coronary artery disease 
      (CAD). We hypothesized that both ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 
      receptor antagonist (AT(1)-A) increase bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) by 
      reducing oxidative stress in the vessel wall, possibly by increasing EC-SOD 
      activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with CAD were randomized to 4 
      weeks of ACEI (ramipril 10 mg/d) or AT(1)-A (losartan 100 mg/d). FDD of the 
      radial artery was determined by high-resolution ultrasound before and after 
      intra-arterial N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit NO synthase and before 
      and after intra-arterial vitamin C to determine the portion of FDD inhibited by 
      oxygen free radicals. EC-SOD activity was determined after release from 
      endothelium by heparin bolus injection. FDD was improved after ramipril and 
      losartan (each group P<0.01), and in particular, the portion of FDD mediated by 
      NO, ie, inhibited by L-NMMA, was increased by >75% (each group P<0.01). Vitamin C 
      improved FDD initially, an effect that was lost after ramipril or losartan. After 
      therapy, EC-SOD activity was increased by >200% in both groups (ACEI, 14.4+/-1.1 
      versus 3.8+/-0.9 and AT(1)-A, 13.5+/-1.0 versus 3.9+/-0.9 U. mL(-1). min(-1); 
      each P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS-Four weeks of therapy with ramipril or losartan 
      improves endothelial function to similar extents in patients with CAD by 
      increasing the bioavailability of NO. Our results suggest that beneficial 
      long-term effects of interference with the renin-angiotensin system may be 
      related to reduction of oxidative stress within the arterial wall, mediated in 
      part by increased EC-SOD activity.

TI  - AVE 0991, a nonpeptide mimic of the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on the 
      endothelium.
PG  - 847-52
AB  - Recently, we demonstrated that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-[1-7]) 
      exhibits a favorable kinetic of nitric oxide (NO) release accompanied by 
      extremely low superoxide (O2-) production. In this report we describe AVE 0991, a 
      novel nonpeptide compound that evoked effects similar to Ang-(1-7) on the 
      endothelium. AVE 0991 and unlabeled Ang-(1-7) competed for high-affinity binding 
      of [125I]-Ang-(1-7) to bovine aortic endothelial cell membranes with IC50 values 
      of 21+/-35 and 220+/-280 nmol/L, respectively. Stimulated NO and O2- release from 
      bovine aortic endothelial cells was directly and simultaneously measured on the 
      cell surface by selective electrochemical nanosensors. Peak concentrations of NO 
      and O2- release by AVE 0991 and Ang-(1-7) (both 10 micromol/L) were not 
      significantly different (NO: 295+/-20 and 270+/-25 nmol/L; O2-: 18+/-2 and 20+/-4 
      nmol/L). However, the released amount of bioactive NO was approximately 5 times 
      higher for AVE 0991 in comparison to Ang-(1-7). The selective Ang-(1-7) 
      antagonist [D-Ala(7)]-Ang-(1-7) inhibited the AVE 0991-induced NO and O2- 
      production by approximately 50%. A similar inhibition level was observed for the 
      Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist EXP 3174. In contrast, the Ang II AT2 receptor 
      antagonist PD 123,177 inhibited the AVE 0991-stimulated NO production by 
      approximately 90% but without any inhibitory effect on O2- production. Both NO 
      and O2- production were inhibited by NO synthase inhibition ( approximately 70%) 
      and by bradykinin B2 receptor blockade (approximately 80%). AVE 0991 efficiently 
      mimics the effects of Ang-(1-7) on the endothelium, most probably through 
      stimulation of a specific, endothelial Ang-(1-7)-sensitive binding site causing 
      kinin-mediated activation of endothelial NO synthase.

TI  - Characterization of ion currents of murine CD117(pos) stem cells in vitro and 
      their modulation under AT2 R stimulation.
PG  - 274-87
LID - 10.1111/apha.12115 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Hematopoietic stem cells, especially CD117(pos) cells, have been found to 
      possess a regenerative potential in various tissues, in particular cardiac 
      muscle. However, the characterization of the relevant ion currents of stem cells 
      prior to implantation lacks documentation. Activation of angiotensin II type 2 
      receptor (AT2 R) can lead to further cell differentiation and receptor 
      auto-expression and might thus influence electrophysiological properties of 
      CD117(pos) stem cells. This study was designed to functionally characterize 
      membrane currents of CD117(pos) cells under normal and AT2 R-stimulated 
      conditions. METHODS: CD117(pos) murine bone marrow stem cells were isolated with 
      MACS technique and stimulated for the AT2 R with angiotensin II and losartan for 
      3-5 days prior to patch-clamp measurements. RT-PCR was used to determine channel 
      expression. Endothelial properties were analysed with immunocytochemistry and 
      acLDL uptake assay. RESULTS: A well-expressed inward rectifying current (IKir ) 
      was identified in cultured CD117(pos) cells. Furthermore, a ZD 7288 (HCN channel 
      blocker)-sensitive current component was isolated. Voltage-dependent potassium 
      currents and chloride currents were less expressed. A small fraction of cells 
      demonstrated voltage- and time-dependent inward currents. In AT2 R-stimulated 
      cells inward rectifying the hyperpolarization-induced inward currents were 
      slightly attenuated on the translational level but showed increased mRNA 
      expression. Cultured CD117(pos) cells express CD31 and VEGFR-2 and significantly 
      increased the uptake of acLDL. CONCLUSIONS: CD117(pos) cells do not have 
      properties of action potential-generating cells and moderately change their 
      excitability during AT2 R stimulation. Electrophysiological and molecular 
      properties of control and AT2 R-stimulated cells point to a differentiation to 
      vascular endothelial cells. This could increase beneficial vascularization in 
      injured tissues.

TI  - Prediction of drug interaction between oral adsorbent AST-120 and concomitant 
      drugs based on the in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption behavior of the 
      drugs.
PG  - 1353-1361
AB  - PURPOSE: AST-120 is used to decrease the abundance of serum uremic toxins in 
      treatment of chronic kidney disease; however, it could also adsorb concomitantly 
      administered drugs. This study aimed to develop a prediction method for drug 
      interaction between AST-120 and concomitantly administered drugs based on in 
      vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption behavior. METHODS: Sixty-eight drugs 
      were selected for the analysis. For each drug, theoretical dissolution (R (d)) 
      and absorption (R (a)) rates at estimated dosing intervals (1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 
      and 240 min) were calculated using the Noyes-Whitney formula and compartment 
      analysis, respectively. The optimal thresholds for R (d) and R (a) (R (dth) and R 
      (ath)) were estimated by comparing the results with those of previous drug 
      interaction studies for six drugs. Four drug interaction risk categories for 68 
      drugs at each dose interval were defined according to the indices of dissolution 
      and absorption against their thresholds. RESULTS: The in vitro dissolution and in 
      vivo absorption behavior of the selected drugs were well fitted to the 
      Noyes-Whitney formula and one- or two-compartment models. The optimal R (dth) and 
      R (ath) that gave the highest value of consistency with the equivalence of drug 
      interaction studies were 90 and 30 %, respectively. As the dosing intervals were 
      lengthened, the number of drugs classified into the low-risk categories 
      increased. CONCLUSION: A new drug interaction prediction method based on the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs was developed. The new model is useful for 
      estimating the risk of drug interaction in clinical practice when AST-120 is used 
      in combination with other drugs.

TI  - The basel cocktail for simultaneous phenotyping of human cytochrome P450 isoforms 
      in plasma, saliva and dried blood spots.
PG  - 271-282
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0115-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Phenotyping cocktails use a combination of cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP)-specific probe drugs to simultaneously assess the activity of 
      different CYP isoforms. To improve the clinical applicability of CYP phenotyping, 
      the main objectives of this study were to develop a new cocktail based on probe 
      drugs that are widely used in clinical practice and to test whether alternative 
      sampling methods such as collection of dried blood spots (DBS) or saliva could be 
      used to simplify the sampling process. METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 
      a new combination of commercially available probe drugs (the Basel cocktail) was 
      tested for simultaneous phenotyping of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 
      and CYP3A4. Sixteen subjects received low doses of caffeine, efavirenz, losartan, 
      omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in different combinations. All subjects were 
      genotyped, and full pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs and their main 
      metabolites were determined in plasma, dried blood spots and saliva samples. 
      RESULTS: The Basel cocktail was well tolerated, and bioequivalence tests showed 
      no evidence of mutual interactions between the probe drugs. In plasma, single 
      timepoint metabolic ratios at 2 h (for CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) or at 8 h (for the 
      other isoforms) after dosing showed high correlations with corresponding area 
      under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios (AUC0-24h parent/AUC0-24h 
      metabolite) and are proposed as simple phenotyping metrics. Metabolic ratios in 
      dried blood spots (for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19) or in saliva samples (for CYP1A2) were 
      comparable to plasma ratios and offer the option of minimally invasive or 
      non-invasive phenotyping of these isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: This new combination of 
      phenotyping probe drugs can be used without mutual interactions. The proposed 
      sampling timepoints have the potential to facilitate clinical application of 
      phenotyping but require further validation in conditions of altered CYP activity. 
      The use of DBS or saliva samples seems feasible for phenotyping of the selected 
      CYP isoforms.

TI  - Losartan potassium, a nonpeptide antagonist of angiotensin II, chronically 
      administered p.o. does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.
PG  - 147-51
AB  - Recently several novel nonpeptide antagonists of angiotensin II (Ang II) have 
      been identified. One of these, losartan potassium (formerly DuP 753) was 
      developed as an orally active and highly selective antagonist for Ang II. As it 
      is inhibited by sulfhydryl agents, it is specific for the AT1 receptor subtype. 
      Since Ang II has both central and peripheral effects, we investigated whether 
      losartan, given p.o. chronically, crosses the blood-brain barrier. The effects of 
      chronic administration of losartan orally (p.o.) at 3 mg/kg per day for three 
      days on the dipsogenic and pressor responses to a pre-established dose of Ang II 
      i.v.t. (50 ng) were studied. Three series of experiments were carried out using 
      conscious normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were injected with Ang II 
      intraventricularly (i.v.t.) before and after treatment of losartan p.o. and blood 
      pressure and drinking responses measured. The experiments established that 3 
      mg/kg losartan p.o. for 3 days antagonized pressor effects of Ang II 
      intravenously (i.v.), but did not antagonize the pressor or drinking effects of 
      Ang II i.v.t. Daily water intake significantly increased with chronic losartan 
      p.o.. Since chronic administration of losartan p.o. was able to block the effects 
      of Ang II i.v. but had no effect on Ang II i.v.t. we conclude that losartan 
      potassium does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier using this dose regimen.

TI  - Phenotype-Genotype Correlation Applying a Cocktail Approach and an Exome Chip 
      Analysis Reveals Further Variants Contributing to Variation of Drug Metabolism.
PG  - 204-216

AB  - Although great progress has been made in the fine-tuning of diplotypes, there is 
      still a need to further improve the predictability of individual phenotypes of 
      pharmacogenetically relevant enzymes. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
      additional contribution of sex and variants identified by exome chip analysis to 
      the metabolic ratio of five probe drugs. A cocktail study applying 
      dextromethorphan, losartan, omeprazole, midazolam, and caffeine was conducted on 
      200 healthy volunteers. CYP2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5, and 1A2 genotypes were analyzed 
      and correlated with metabolic ratios. In addition, an exome chip analysis was 
      performed. These SNPs correlating with metabolic ratios were confirmed by 
      individual genotyping. The contribution of various factors to metabolic ratios 
      was assessed by multiple regression analysis. Genotypically predicted phenotypes 
      defined by CPIC discriminated very well the log metabolic ratios with the 
      exception of caffeine. There were minor sex differences in the activity of 
      CYP2C9, 2C19, 1A2, and CYP3A4/5. For dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), IP6K2 
      (rs61740999) and TCF20 (rs5758651) affected metabolic ratios, but only IP6K2 
      remained significant after multiple regression analysis. For losartan (CYP2C9), 
      FBXW12 (rs17080138), ZNF703 (rs79707182), and SLC17A4 (rs11754288) together with 
      CYP diplotypes, and sex explained 50% of interindividual variability. For 
      omeprazole (CYP2C19), no significant influence of CYP2C:TG haplotypes was 
      observed, but CYP2C19 rs12777823 improved the predictability. The comprehensive 
      genetic analysis and inclusion of sex in a multiple regression model 
      significantly improved the explanation of variability of metabolic ratios, 
      resulting in further improvement of algorithms for the prediction of individual 
      phenotypes of drug-metabolizing enzymes.

      preparing gas-generated multiple-unit floating drug delivery systems.

AB  - Among various strategies of gastroretentive drug delivery systems (DDSs) 
      developed to prolong the gastric residence time and to increase the overall 
      bioavailability, effervescent multiple-unit floating DDSs (muFDDSs) were studied 
      here. These systems consist of drug (losartan)- and effervescent (sodium 
      bicarbonate)-containing pellets coated with a blended polymeric membrane, which 
      was a mixture of gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-soluble and GIT-insoluble polymers. 
      The addition of GIT-soluble polymers, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, PEG 600, and Kollicoat® IR, greatly increased the 
      water uptake ability of the GIT-insoluble polymers (Eudragit® NE, RS, and RL; 
      Surelease®; and Kollicoat® SR) and caused them to immediately initiate the 
      effervescent reaction and float, but the hydrated films should also be 
      impermeable to the generated CO(2) to maintain floatation and sufficiently 
      flexible to withstand the pressure of carbon dioxide to avoid rupturing. The 
      study demonstrated that the water uptake ability and mechanical properties could 
      be applied as screening tools during the development of effervescent muFDDSs. The 
      optimized system of SRT(5)P600(5) (i.e., a mixture of 5% Kollicoat® SR and 5% PEG 
      600) with a 20% coating level began to completely float within 15 min and 
      maintained its buoyancy over a period of 12 h with a sustained-release effect.

TI  - Dietary protein modulates intrarenal distribution of renin and its mRNA during 
      development.
PG  - F427-35
AB  - To determine whether high protein feeding throughout development affects renal 
      growth, renal hemodynamics, and the intrarenal distribution of renin and its mRNA 
      in the adult animal, male Wistar rats were fed diets containing either 20% 
      protein [normal (NP), n = 12] or 40% protein [high (HP), n = 12] from weaning 
      until studied at 6 or 12 wk of age. Kidney weight, kidney weight-to-body weight 
      ratio, cortical DNA content, and cortical protein-to-DNA ratio were higher in HP- 
      than in NP-fed rats at 6 and 12 wk of age. Somatic and kidney growth response to 
      HP was blunted by angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist Dup 753. Glomerular 
      filtration rate and renal plasma flow were higher in HP- than in NP-fed rats at 6 
      and 12 wk of age. The intrarenal distribution of renin and renin mRNA, assessed 
      by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, were markedly 
      different between the two groups. In NP-fed rats, renin and renin mRNA were 
      confined to a juxtaglomerular location. In HP-fed rats, renin and its mRNA 
      extended proximally along the afferent arterioles. The percentage of visible 
      afferent arteriolar length containing renin or renin mRNA was higher in HP-fed 
      rats (60 +/- 3.2 and 61 +/- 3.9%, respectively) than in NP-fed rats (39 +/- 2.5 
      and 33 +/- 0.6%; P less than 0.05). Also, the percentage of juxtaglomerular 
      apparatuses (JGAs) containing renin or renin mRNA was higher in HP-fed rats (80 
      +/- 1.6 and 72 +/- 2%, respectively), than in NP-fed rats (46 +/- 2.2 and 40 +/- 
      4%; P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Liquid chromatographic determination of irbesartan in human plasma.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - A simple and sensitive method was developed for determination of irbesartan by 
      liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Irbesartan and losartan (I.S.) 
      in human plasma were extracted using diethyl ether:dichloromethane (7:3, v/v) 
      followed by back extraction with 0.05 M sodium hydroxide. Neutralized samples 
      were analyzed using 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (containing 
      0.07% triethylamine as peak modifier, pH was adjusted with orthophosphoric acid 
      to pH 3.0) and acetonitrile (66:34, v/v). Chromatographic separation was achieved 
      on an ODS-C-18 column (100 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., particle size 5 microm) using 
      isocratic elution (at flow rate 1.25 ml/min). The peak was detected using a 
      fluorescence detector set at Ex 259 nm and Em 385 nm, and the total time for a 
      chromatographic separation was approximately 13 min. The validated quantitation 
      ranges of this method were 15-4000 ng/ml with coefficients of variation between 
      0.75 and 12.53%. Mean recoveries were 73.3-77.1% with coefficients of variation 
      of 3.7-6.3%. The between- and within-batch precision were 0.4-2.2% and 0.9-6.2%, 
      respectively. The between- and within-batch relative errors (bias) were (-5.5) to 
      0.9% and (-0.6) to 6.9%, respectively. Stability of irbesartan in plasma was 
      >89%, with no evidence of degradation during sample processing and 60 days 
      storage in a deep freezer at -70 degrees C. This validated method is sensitive 
      and simple with between-batch precision of <3% and can be used for 
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - MAP Kinase in the rat adrenal gland.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - The role of MAP Kinase (MAPK/ERK) in adrenal growth and steroidogenesis is 
      unclear, though in other tissues it is known to act as an integrator of mitogenic 
      signals originating from receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled 
      receptors. Angiotensin II (AngII) is a major regulator of tissue differentiation 
      and function in the adrenal, acting mainly through the AT1 receptor. 
      Immunocytochemical and enzyme assay methods were used to study the distribution 
      of MAPK and the action of AngII and associated antagonists saralasin and 
      losartan(DuP753) in the rat adrenal gland. MAPK is localised in the zona 
      glomerulosa (ZG) and the medulla, but absent from the zonae fasiculata and 
      reticularis (ZF/ZR). Stimulation with AngII led to decreases in cytosolic and 
      increases in nuclear MAPK activity, and its redistribution from the cytoplasm in 
      unstimulated cells to its localisation around the nucleus, which was confirmed by 
      immunocytochemistry. This translocation was inhibited in the presence of the 
      AngII antagonist saralasin. Therefore, MAPK is located in the glomerulosa, where 
      the AT1 receptor is localised and concerned with aldosterone biosynthesis, and in 
      the medulla where MAPK activation results from AT2R activation. The results 
      indicate the importance of the glomerulosa as the main site of cell proliferation 
      in the adrenal cortex, and that MAPK may represent new signalling pathways 
      related to zone function in the adrenal gland.

TI  - Distribution and function of cardiac angiotensin AT1- and AT2-receptor subtypes 
      in hypertrophied rat hearts.
PG  - H844-52
AB  - To determine distribution and function of cardiac angiotensin (ANG) II receptor 
      AT1 and AT2 subtypes in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), ANG II (10(-8) 
      M) was infused into isolated rat hearts with hypertrophy from aortic banding and 
      into sham-operated controls. ANG II was infused alone or in the presence of AT1 
      inhibitor [losartan (10(-5) M) or CL-329167 (10(-7) M)] or AT2 inhibitor 
      [CG-42112A (10(-8) M]. ANG II alone caused less increase in coronary vascular 
      resistance (CVR) in LVH compared with control hearts (19 vs. 39%; P < 0.01), 
      although baseline CVR was higher in LVH hearts. This was prevented by AT1 but not 
      AT2 antagonists. ANG II also increased LV end-diastolic pressure in LVH hearts, 
      signifying decreased diastolic relaxation that was prevented by AT1 but not AT2 
      inhibition. Characterization of ANG II binding sites in LV membrane preparations 
      revealed similar dissociation constants between groups (1.6 +/- 0.95 vs. 2.2 +/- 
      2.0 nM; not significant) but lower maximum binding capacity in the LVH group 
      (21.1 +/- 5.9 vs. 33.5 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg protein; P < 0.05). Competition assays 
      demonstrated that control left ventricles contain predominantly the AT1 subtype 
      (68.8 +/- 20%), whereas LVH ventricles contain primarily the putative AT2 subtype 
      (59.8% +/- 10.8%; P < 0.05). This suggests that receptor subtype redistribution 
      occurs in LVH with AT1 subtype down-regulation. Nonetheless, the AT1 subtype 
      mediates the effects of ANG II on coronary tone and diastolic dysfunction in 
      pressure-overload hypertrophy.

TI  - Losartan decreases glomerular filtration rate in isolated perfused porcine 
      slaughterhouse kidneys.
PG  - 199-208
AB  - We investigated whether Losartan, an angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1 receptor 
      antagonist, decreases renal vascular resistance (RVR) and increases glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) in isolated perfused porcine slaughterhouse kidneys (11 
      control experiments and 11 Losartan experiments with 7.5mg Losartan in the 
      preservation solution and 100(g/minute Losartan infused during perfusion). With 
      perfusion, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased markedly from 3 +/- 1 to 90 +/- 
      17 ng Ang I/ml/h (control), and from 4 +/- 1 to 70 +/- 8 ng Ang I/ml/h 
      (Losartan), plasma Ang II increased from 86 +/- 63 to 482 +/- 111 pg/ml 
      (control), and from 73 +/- 42 to 410 +/- 91 pg/ml (Losartan). The GFR was 
      decreased in Losartan experiments as compared with control experiments (5 +/- 1 
      versus 10 +/- 2 ml/min/100g kidney wt; p < 0.05). The RVR was the same in both 
      groups (0.2 +/- 0.01 mm Hg/100g kidney wt/min/ml). Tubular sodium reabsorption 
      was decreased in Losartan experiments as compared with control experiments (0.7 
      +/- 0.1 versus 1.4 +/- 0.3 mmol/min/100g kidney wt). Overall, Losartan 
      accentuated pathophysiological signs of acute renal failure. Although other drugs 
      have to be investigated, these results suggest that porcine slaughterhouse 
      kidneys could be useful as a tool for research in areas such as transplantation 
      and intensive-care medicine.

TI  - Overexpression of angiotensin II type I receptor in cardiomyocytes induces 
      cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - Angiotensin II (AII) is a major determinant of arterial pressure and volume 
      homeostasis, mainly because of its vascular action via the AII type 1 receptor 
      (AT1R). AII has also been implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy 
      because angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1R antagonists prevent 
      or regress ventricular hypertrophy in animal models and in human. However, 
      because these treatments impede the action of AII at cardiac as well as vascular 
      levels, and reduce blood pressure, it has been difficult to determine whether AII 
      action on the heart is direct or a consequence of pressure-overload. To determine 
      whether AII can induce cardiac hypertrophy directly via myocardial AT1R in the 
      absence of vascular changes, transgenic mice overexpressing the human AT1R under 
      the control of the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter were generated. 
      Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of AT1R induced, in basal conditions, 
      morphologic changes of myocytes and nonmyocytes that mimic those observed during 
      the development of cardiac hypertrophy in human and in other mammals. These mice 
      displayed significant cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling with increased 
      expression of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor and interstitial collagen 
      deposition and died prematurely of heart failure. Neither the systolic blood 
      pressure nor the heart rate were changed. The data demonstrate a direct 
      myocardial role for AII in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure and 
      provide a useful model to elucidate the mechanisms of action of AII in the 
      pathogenesis of cardiac diseases.

TI  - Trophic effects of angiotensin II on neonatal rat cardiac myocytes are mediated 
      by cardiac fibroblasts.
PG  - E426-37
AB  - Cultured neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NF) and myocytes (NM) were used to 
      examine the distribution of angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors and the potential 
      role of NF in mediating the trophic response to ANG II in the heart. In NM 
      preparations cultured for 2-5 days, specific binding to 125I-ANG II was < 10% of 
      the specific binding in cultured NF. Binding assays, immunocytochemistry, and 
      autoradiography in NM cultured for > 5 days identified two populations of cells, 
      one with fibroblast-like morphology and high density of ANG II receptors and 
      another with low binding, comparable to NM cultures at day 5 or earlier. 
      Conditioned medium (CM) from untreated NF increased cell surface area and net 
      [3H]leucine (Leu) incorporation 1.4-fold in NM. CM from ANG II-treated NF 
      enhanced [3H]Leu incorporation 2.2-fold in NM. This potentiating effect of ANG II 
      was inhibited by losartan and was absent when ANG II was added directly to NM. In 
      addition, studies using antibodies and bioassay for transforming growth 
      factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) suggested that TGF-beta 1 does not mediate the trophic 
      effects of ANG II on NM. We conclude that ANG II receptors are localized 
      predominantly on NF and that ANG II can indirectly stimulate hypertrophy of NM by 
      stimulating NF to produce a transferrable factor(s). These data suggest that 
      cardiac fibroblasts may play a critical role in mediating the hypertrophic 
      response to ANG II in the rat heart.

TI  - Interaction of nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists with the urate 
      transporter in rat renal brush-border membranes.
PG  - 125-9
AB  - The angiotensin II (AII) antagonist, losartan, increases uric acid excretion when 
      administered to humans. However, the active metabolite of losartan, EXP 3174, and 
      other nonpeptide AII antagonists such as eprosartan and SB 203220 are devoid of 
      uricosuric activity. To investigate the mechanism of losartan-induced uricosuria, 
      we examined the effects of losartan, EXP 3174, eprosartan and SB 203220 on OH- 
      -dependent [14C]urate uptake into rat proximal tubule brush-border membrane 
      vesicles. Losartan (10 microM) inhibited [14C]urate uptake at all time points 
      examined, except at equilibrium (2 hr). Losartan had no effect on urate uptake in 
      the absence of an OH- gradient. The inhibitory effect of losartan on urate uptake 
      was concentration dependent (IC50 = 9.5 +/- 1.4 microM) and competitive in 
      nature. The other AII antagonists also inhibited urate uptake but were 6-8-fold 
      less potent than losartan with IC50 values of EXP 3174 (65 +/- 13 microM), 
      eprosartan (60 +/- 7.0 microM) and SB 203220 (74 +/- 12.5 microM). In contrast to 
      the effects of the nonpeptide AII antagonists, the peptide antagonist, 
      Sar1,Ile8-AII, as well as AII itself had no effect on urate uptake. These results 
      suggest that the uricosuric activity of losartan is, at least in part, due to 
      inhibition of urate reabsorption in the proximal tubule and is unrelated to AII 
      receptor activity. Furthermore, losartan has a greater affinity for the 
      urate/anion exchanger than the other AII antagonists tested. These results are in 
      direct agreement with observations made after administration of these compounds 
      to humans.

TI  - Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system improves insulin sensitivity in thermal 
      injury.
PG  - 485-8
AB  - Insulin resistance after burn is associated with alterations in postreceptor 
      insulin signaling and abnormal glucose homeostasis. The renin-angiotensin system 
      (RAS) exerts a largely inhibitory role on insulin action and is activated after 
      burn injury. We hypothesized that upregulation of RAS is involved in the 
      development of insulin resistance in burned rats. We examined the possibility 
      that an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, losartan, enhances insulin 
      sensitivity and thereby increases glucose tolerance in thermally injured rats. A 
      30% body surface area burn was induced by immersion of the dorsum into water with 
      a temperature level of 95 degrees C for 15 s. Sham-burned rats were immersed in 
      water with a temperature level of 23 degrees C. Losartan (30 mg/kg per day) or 
      placebo (water) was given by gavage immediately after the burn injury and daily 
      for 3 days postburn injury, resulting in sham-burned, burn placebo, and burn 
      losartan groups. Plasma angiotensin II levels between burn placebo and 
      sham-burned groups were not different 3 days after burn injury. However, losartan 
      significantly increased plasma angiotensin II levels (P < 0.05), suggesting 
      blockade of the AT1 receptor. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed 3 days 
      postburn injury. There was an increase in the area under the curve for insulin 
      and the glucose insulin index in burn placebo group as compared with sham-burned 
      group, indicating insulin resistance. Losartan treatment abolished the insulin 
      resistance in burn as evidenced by an area under the curve for insulin and 
      glucose insulin index lower than that in the burn placebo group and similar to 
      that in the sham-burned group. This suggests that insulin resistance and glucose 
      intolerance associated with burn injury is, in part, caused by RAS.

AB  - DESIGN: Angiotensin II (AII; 0.2, 5 and 25 nM) was infused during a single-pass 
      perfusion of a rat liver via both the hepatic artery and the portal vein (portal 
      or arterial AII). Infusion occurred both in the absence and in the presence of 
      the AT1-receptor-antagonist losartan (1 and 10 microM). METABOLISM: Arterial and 
      portal AII increased glucose output and shifted lactate uptake to release. Portal 
      AII was 3 (0.2 nM) and 1.5 times (5 and 25 nM) more effective in increasing 
      hepatic glucose release than similar levels of arterial AII. However, 0.2, 5 and 
      25 nM of arterially and portally applied AII had a similar level of efficiency in 
      switching lactate uptake to release. The metabolic alterations by arterial and 
      portal AII were, however, strongly inhibited by the addition of 1 microM losartan 
      (an AT1-receptor-antagonist) and completely blocked by the presence of 10 microM 
      losartan. HAEMODYNAMICS: Arterial and portal AII decreased the flow in the 
      ipsilateral vessels to a similar extent, both demonstrating similar kinetics. 
      Medium and high levels of arterial and portal AII caused pronounced flow 
      alterations of the contralateral vessels. The AII-dependent reductions of 
      arterial and portal flow were strongly inhibited by the presence of 1 microM 
      losartan and were stopped by 10 microM of this blocker. RESULTS: The results 
      demonstrate that arterial and portal AII caused alterations in the hepatic 
      metabolism, demonstrating either clear (glucose balance) or no (lactate balance) 
      differences, produced similar reductions of the ipsilateral flow, and pronounced 
      and complex modulations of the contralateral flow.

AB  - The molecular mechanism of insurmountable antagonism was investigated to a large 
      extent in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human angiotensin II 
      receptor type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. It was proposed that AT(1) receptor antagonists 
      interact with their receptor according to a two-state receptor model. Briefly, 
      this theoretical model reveals that antagonist bound AT(1) receptor can adopt a 
      fast and a slow reversible state. The first, fast reversible state is similar for 
      all antagonists, while the slow reversible state displays the characteristics of 
      each antagonist. In the present study, we performed competition experiments with 
      the AT(1) receptor antagonists candesartan, EXP3174, irbesartan, losartan and 
      ligand [3H]-angiotensin II at 0-4 degrees. This gave the opportunity to verify 
      the two-state model for the first time with experimental data.

TI  - A rapid HPLC method for the determination of losartan in human plasma using a 
      monolithic column.
PG  - 569-72
AB  - A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using a 
      monolithic column has been developed for quantification of losartan (CAS 
      12450-98-8) in plasma. The assay enables the measurement of losartan for 
      therapeutic drug monitoring. The method involves a simple, one-step extraction 
      procedure. The analytical recovery was complete. The separation was carried out 
      in reversed-phase conditions using a Chromolith Performance (RP-18e, 100 x 4.6 
      mm) column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 0.01 mol/L disodium 
      hydrogen phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (60:40 v/v) adjusted to pH 3.5. The 
      wavelength was set at 254 nm. Thioridazine (CAS 50-52-2) was used as internal 
      standard. Losartan, thioridazine and the EXP 3174, the active metabolite of 
      losartan, appeared 3.4, 5.0 and 10.5 min post injection, respectively. The 
      calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 5-300 ng mL(-1) with a 
      minimum detectable limit of 2 ng mL(-1). The coefficients of variation for the 
      inter-day and intra-day assay were found to be less than 8 %. The applicability 
      of this method for pharmacokinetic studies in humans was demonstrated. The 
      present assay is rapid, simple, precise, and accurate and is suitable for 
      pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the possible interaction between selected 
      concomitant medications and orlistat at steady state in healthy subjects.
PG  - 1011-9
AB  - To investigate the influence of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics of selected 
      concomitant medications (amitriptyline, atorvastatin, cyclosporine, losartan, 
      metformin, phentermine, and sibutramine) at or within two-fold of therapeutic 
      doses, open-label, multiple-dose (for 6 or 7 days), randomized, two-period 
      (except for cyclosporine, for which a three-way crossover design was used) 
      crossover studies were performed in healthy volunteers ages 18 to 65 years, with 
      a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2. At steady state, blood samples were 
      taken for measuring plasma concentrations of interacting drugs and/or active 
      metabolites. Subjects were also evaluated for adverse events, vital signs, and 
      clinical and laboratory safety. Treatments were compared for AUC0-24, Cmax, tmax, 
      and t1/2 of selected concomitant medications (parent drugs and/or active 
      metabolites). ANOVA was performed to assess the significance of the carry-over 
      effect and provide the variance estimate for the 90% confidence intervals (CIs). 
      With the exception of cyclosporine, whose absorption was reduced by approximately 
      one-third, the results of the statistical analysis demonstrated equivalencefor 
      the two primary parameters for all drugs studied: ratios of the log-transformed 
      means for both AUC and Cmax were close to 1.00, with 90% CIs contained entirely 
      within the bioequivalence region of 0.80 to 1.25; there were no clinically 
      significant differences in t1/2 and tmax. There was a higher incidence of adverse 
      events under treatment B (selective concomitant medications and orlistat) than 
      under treatment A (selective concomitant medications alone); most of this 
      difference was due to expected gastrointestinal adverse events known to occur 
      with orlistat. Other adverse events were sporadic and unremarkable. All adverse 
      events were either mild or moderate in intensity. There were no clinically 
      relevant changes in vital signs or laboratory values. In conclusion, except for 
      cyclosporine, there was no effect of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics of 
      selective concomitant medications when these drugs were taken concomitantly with 
      orlistat.

TI  - Increased plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides by selective beta1-blocker 
      bisoprolol.
PG  - 462-8
AB  - Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to be associated with an increase in the 
      plasma concentration of A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP). Whether the plasma 
      concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which is mainly derived from 
      ventricular tissue, is also increased and whether this increase is caused by 
      increased production or decreased metabolism by down-regulation of the 
      natriuretic peptide-clearance receptor remains to be established. In a 
      double-blind crossover study effects of 8 weeks' treatment of bisoprolol,10 mg 
      once daily, and losartan, 50 mg once daily, on plasma concentrations of ANP, BNP, 
      and N-terminal (Nt)-ANP and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) were measured in 24 
      hypertensive patients. With bisoprolol plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP 
      increased (P < 0.001) by 93 +/- 88% (mean +/- SD) and 148 +/- 117%, whereas these 
      parameters did not change with losartan. Nt-ANP, which is not metabolized by the 
      NP clearance receptor, increased by 83 +/- 45%, and increments in ANP and Nt-ANP 
      were related (r =0.77, P < 0.001). The decrease in ABP was greater with 
      bisoprolol than with losartan. Monotherapy with bisoprolol, but not with 
      losartan, is associated with substantial increments in plasma concentrations of 
      ANP, Nt-ANP, and BNP. As the magnitude of the increase in ANP and Nt-ANP was 
      comparable, the beta-blocker-induced increase in NPs is not likely to be 
      explained by a decrease in NP clearance receptor density.

TI  - Intracellular angiotensin II elicits Ca2+ increases in A7r5 vascular smooth 
      muscle cells.
PG  - 9-18
AB  - Recent studies show that angiotensin II can act within the cell, possibly via 
      intracellular receptors pharmacologically different from typical plasma membrane 
      angiotensin II receptors. The signal transduction of intracellular angiotensin II 
      is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of intracellular angiotensin 
      II in cells devoid of physiological responses to extracellular angiotensin II 
      (A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells). Intracellular delivery of angiotensin II was 
      obtained by using liposomes or cell permeabilisation. Intracellular angiotensin 
      II stimulated Ca2+ influx, as measured by 45Ca2+ uptake and single-cell 
      fluorimetry. This effect was insensitive to extracellular or intracellular 
      addition of losartan (angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist) or PD123319 
      ((s)-1-(4-[dimethylamino]-3-methylphenyl)methyl-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylate) 
      (angiotensin AT2 receptor antagonist). Intracellular angiotensin II stimulated 
      inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,)P3) production and increased the size of 
      the Ins(1,4,5,)P3 releasable 45Ca2+ pool in permeabilised cells, independent of 
      losartan and PD123319. Small G-proteins did not participate in this process, as 
      assessed by using GDPbetaS. Intracellular delivery of angiotensin I was unable to 
      elicit any of the effects elicited by intracellular angiotensin II. We conclude 
      from our intracellular angiotensin application experiments that angiotensin II 
      modulates Ca2+ homeostasis even in the absence of extracellular actions. 
      Pharmacological properties suggest the involvement of putative angiotensin 
      non-AT1-/non-AT2 receptors.

TI  - Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists induce human in-vitro adipogenesis 
      through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation.
PG  - 1809-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In clonal animal cells, certain angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) 
      activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). The 
      aim of this work was to validate that observation in human cells and humans. 
      METHODS: We investigated the induction of in-vitro adipogenesis and the 
      activation of PPARgamma-target genes, adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase, by ARB 
      in human preadipocytes. We also studied PPARgamma response-element-driven 
      luciferase reporter gene activation in human adipocytes. Finally, we treated 14 
      obese men for 10 days with placebo crossed over with 150 mg/day irbesartan. 
      Subcutaneous fat was analyzed for mRNA expression of adiponectin and lipoprotein 
      lipase. RESULTS: Telmisartan and irbesartan, and to a lesser degree losartan, 
      induced adipogenesis and activated PPARgamma-target genes. This stimulation of 
      PPARgamma-target genes was prevented by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. 
      Eprosartan had no effect. Paradoxically, all ARB activated the luciferase 
      reporter gene. PPARgamma activity increased approximately two-fold with 
      pioglitazone and 1.5-fold with the ARB in all assays. In the cross-over clinical 
      study, irbesartan lowered blood pressure but had no effect on adiponectin or 
      lipoprotein lipase mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are the first to show 
      that ARB induce adipogenesis and PPARgamma-target gene expression in human 
      adipocytes. Pharmacokinetic differences may contribute to the heterogeneous 
      effects on metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation. In humans, larger doses 
      of ARB, longer treatments, or both may be required to activate PPARgamma in 
      adipose cells.

TI  - Increased colonic sodium absorption in rats with chronic renal failure is 
      partially mediated by AT1 receptor agonism.
PG  - G348-56
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00079.2008 [doi]
AB  - To test the hypothesis that colonic Na(+) transport is altered in the 5/6 
      nephrectomized rat model of chronic renal failure (CRF), we measured Na(+) fluxes 
      across distal colon from control (CON), CRF, and CRF rats treated with the 
      angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonist losartan (+LOS). We also evaluated 
      overall fluid and Na(+) balance and compared colonic protein and mRNA expression 
      profiles for electroneutral [sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE)] and electrogenic 
      Na(+) transport [epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)] in these groups. Consistent 
      with a 60% enhancement in colonic Na(+) absorption in CRF, urinary Na(+) 
      excretion increased by about 50% while serum Na(+) homeostasis was maintained. 
      These CRF-induced changes in Na(+) handling were normalized by treatment with 
      LOS. Net Na(+) absorption was also stimulated in in vitro tissues from CON rats 
      following acute serosal addition of ANG II (10(-7) M), and this increase was 
      blocked by AT(1) antagonism but not by an AT(2) antagonist. In CRF, colonic 
      protein and mRNA expression variably increased for apical NHE2, NHE3, and ENaC 
      alpha-, beta-, gamma-subunits, whereas expression of basolateral NHE1 and 
      Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase (alpha-isoform) remained unaltered. Upregulation of the ENaC 
      subunit mRNA was attenuated somewhat by LOS treatment. Previously, we showed that 
      colonic AT(1) receptor protein is upregulated twofold in CRF, and here we find 
      that AT(1) and AT(2) mRNA and AT(2) protein abundance is unchanged in CRF. We 
      conclude that Na(+) absorption in CRF rat distal colon is increased due to 
      elevated expression of proteins mediating electroneutral and electrogenic uptake 
      and that it is partially mediated by AT(1) receptors.

TI  - Pharmacologic profile of TA-606, a novel angiotensin II-receptor antagonist in 
      the rat.
PG  - 568-75
AB  - This study was carried out to characterize a novel angiotensin II-receptor 
      antagonist, TA-606, (3-pentyloxy) 
      carbonyloxymethyl-5-acetyl-2-n-propyl-3-[2'(1H-tetrazole-5-yl) 
      biphenyl-4-yl]methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro imidazo [4,5-c] pyridine-4-carboxylate 
      hydrochloride, which is a newly synthesized prodrug of 606A. In anesthetized 
      rats, 606A inhibited angiotensin II-induced pressor response with a median 
      inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6 microg/kg, i.v., and was 8 times more potent 
      than EXP3174, an active metabolite of losartan. Bioavailability of TA-606 was 11 
      times higher than that of 606A in Sprague-Dawley rats, with consistent 
      hypotensive potencies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In conscious 
      renal hypertensive rats (RHRs) and conscious SHRs, TA-606 lowered the blood 
      pressure without any effects on the heart rate, and its effective dose for 30 mm 
      Hg (ED30) values were 0.14 and 0.21 mg/kg, p.o., respectively. The effect of 
      TA-606 lasted > 10 h in both models. Moreover, the effect of TA-606 was 
      approximately 30 and 10 times more potent than those of losartan in RHRs and 
      SHRs, respectively. TA-606 did not affect the blood pressure in 
      deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. TA-606 given for 12 
      weeks attenuated the development of hypertension in stroke-prone SHRs. These 
      results indicate that TA-606 is a potent angiotensin II-receptor antagonist with 
      antihypertensive efficacy. Thus TA-606 is suggested to be a possible useful agent 
      in the treatment of hypertension.

TI  - Angiotensin II involvement in adaptive enteric oxalate excretion in rats with 
      chronic renal failure induced by hyperoxaluria.
PG  - 426-32
AB  - Enteric secretion of oxalate is induced in rats that have chronic renal failure 
      produced by 5/6 nephrectomy. The purpose of the present study was to examine 
      renal and intestinal handling of oxalate in rats with chronic renal failure (CRF) 
      induced by chronic hyperoxaluria. A rat model for chronic renal failure, induced 
      by chronic hyperoxaluria (CH-CRF), was produced by unilateral nephrectomy 
      combined with dietary ethylene glycol for 4 weeks. Both intact and unilateral 
      nephrectomized rats (UN) without the oxalate load served as controls. Renal 
      handling of oxalate was assessed by measurement of renal clearance of oxalate and 
      creatinine while colonic handling of oxalate and chloride was determined by in 
      vitro transepithelial flux measurements. Angiotensin II mediation was assessed by 
      sensitivity of the transport processes to the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan. 
      Renal and colonic handling of oxalate in UN rats were similar to intact controls. 
      The CH-CRF rats were hyperoxalemic, hyperoxaluric, and exhibited a twofold 
      increase in oxalate clearance despite a 50% drop in creatinine clearance. Distal 
      (but not proximal) colonic handling of oxalate in CH-CRF rats was reversed from 
      net oxalate absorption seen in UN and intact controls to net secretion that was 
      sensitive to losartan in vitro. CONCLUSION: Although enteric oxalate secretion 
      can be correlated with elevations in plasma oxalate in the absence of overt renal 
      insufficiency by an ANG II-independent mechanism, the present results suggest 
      that some degree of renal insufficiency is necessary to induce ANG II-mediated 
      colonic oxalate secretion.

TI  - Effect of fermented red ginseng on cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein activity in 
      healthy subjects, as evaluated using the cocktail approach.
PG  - 1580-1590
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13080 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We assessed the drug interaction profile of fermented red ginseng with 
      respect to the activity of major cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes and of a drug 
      transporter protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This 
      study was an open-label crossover study. The CYP probe cocktail drugs caffeine, 
      losartan, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, midazolam and fexofenadine were 
      administered before and after 2 weeks of fermented red ginseng administration. 
      Plasma samples were collected, and tolerability was assessed. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were calculated, and the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the 
      geometric mean ratios of the parameters were determined from logarithmically 
      transformed data. Values were compared between before and after fermented red 
      ginseng administration using analysis of variance (anova). RESULTS: Fifteen 
      healthy male subjects were evaluated, none of whom were genetically defined as a 
      poor CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 metabolizer based on genotyping. Before and after 
      fermented red ginseng administration, the geometric least-square mean metabolic 
      ratio (90% CI) was 0.901 (0.830-0.979) for caffeine (CYP1A2) to paraxanthine, 
      0.774 (0.720-0.831) for losartan (CYP2C9) to EXP3174, 1.052 (0.925-1.197) for 
      omeprazole (CYP2C19) to 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 1.150 (0.860-1.538) for 
      dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) to dextrorphan, and 0.816 (0.673-0.990) for midazolam 
      (CYP3A4) to 1-hydroxymidazolam. The geometric mean ratio of the area under the 
      curve of the last sampling time (AUC(last) ) for fexofenadine (P-gp) was 1.322 
      (1.112-1.571). CONCLUSION: No significantly different drug interactions were 
      observed between fermented red ginseng and the CYP probe substrates following the 
      two-week administration of concentrated fermented red ginseng. However, the 
      inhibition of P-gp was significantly different between fermented red ginseng and 
      the CYP probe substrates. The use of fermented red ginseng requires close 
      attention due to the potential for increased systemic exposure when it is used in 
      combination with P-gp substrate drugs.

TI  - Role of intrarenal ANG II in reflex neural stimulation of plasma renin activity 
      and renal sodium reabsorption.
PG  - R392-8
AB  - Renal sympathetic stimulation of plasma renin activity (PRA) and sodium 
      reabsorption was examined in conscious dogs before and during intrarenal 
      angiotensin II (ANG II)-type 1 receptor blockade with losartan (Dup-753) and 
      converting enzyme inhibition. In uninephrectomized dogs, renal function and PRA 
      responses to 14% blood volume depletion (BVD) were measured. BVD was utilized to 
      activate renal sympathetic outflow in the absence of hypotension. In eight 
      vehicle-treated dogs, 14% BVD increased PRA from 1.38 +/- 0.32 to 2.79 +/- 0.66 
      ng ANG I.ml-1 x h-1 and decreased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) from 85.1 +/- 
      11.3 to 45.4 +/- 7.5 mueq/min. During losartan (n = 6) and captopril (n = 5) 
      infusion, plasma renin responses were enhanced in response to 14% BVD (1.93 +/- 
      0.48 to 5.74 +/- 2.25 and 3.03 +/- 0.73 to 9.19 +/- 1.94 ng ANG I.ml-1 x h-1, 
      respectively), whereas antinatriuretic responses were similar to vehicle-infused 
      dogs. Thus, neurogenic antinatriuresis is not mediated by secondary generation of 
      ANG II, since UNaV decreased similarly to control in all conditions of ANG II 
      blockade. Tonic intrarenal and/or circulating ANG II synthesis of dogs on a 
      normal sodium diet inhibit neurogenic stimulation of renin release, since PRA 
      responses were enhanced after blockade of ANG II.

AB  - Growing body of evidence points out the crucial role of ACE2 in preventing 
      atherosclerosis. However, data on how atherosclerosis affects ACE2 expression in 
      heart and kidney remains unknown. Atherosclerosis was induced by feeding New 
      Zealand White rabbits with high cholesterol diet (HCD - 2%) for 12 weeks and 
      atorvastatin was administered (5mg/kg/day p.o) in last 3 weeks. ACE2 mRNA and 
      protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and real time PCR. HCD fed 
      rabbits developed atherosclerosis as confirmed by increase in plasma total 
      cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides as well as formation atherosclerotic plaques 
      in arch of aorta. The ACE2 protein but not mRNA expression was reduced in heart 
      and kidney of HCD rabbits. Interestingly, atorvastatin increased the ACE2 protein 
      expression in heart and kidney of HCD rabbits. However, atorvastatin increased 
      ACE2 mRNA in heart but not in kidney of HCD rabbits. Atorvastatin increased the 
      occupancy of histone H3 acetylation (H3-Ac) mark on ACE2 promoter region in heart 
      of HCD rabbits indicating direct or indirect epigenetic up-regulation of ACE2 by 
      atorvastatin. Further, atorvastatin suppressed Ang II-induced contractile 
      responses and enhanced AT2 receptor mediated relaxant responses in 
      atherosclerotic aorta. We propose that atherosclerosis is associated with reduced 
      ACE2 expression in heart and kidney. We also show an unexplored potential of 
      atorvastatin to up-regulate ACE2 via epigenetic histone modifications. Our data 
      suggest a novel way of replenishing ACE2 expression for preventing not only 
      atherosclerosis but also other cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - Multiplex Phenotyping for Systems Medicine: A One-Point Optimized Practical 
      Sampling Strategy for Simultaneous Estimation of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
      CYP2D6 Activities Using a Cocktail Approach.
PG  - 88-96
LID - 10.1089/omi.2015.0131 [doi]
AB  - Phenotyping of the CYP450 enzyme activities contributes to personalized medicine, 
      but the past phenotyping approaches have followed a piecemeal strategy measuring 
      single enzyme activities in vivo. A barrier to phenotyping of populations in 
      rural and remote areas is the limited time and resources for sample collection. 
      The CEIBA cocktail approach allows metabolic capacity estimation of multiple 
      CYP450 enzymes in a single sample analysis, but the attendant sample collection 
      schemes for applications in diverse global settings are yet to be optimized. The 
      present study aimed to select an optimal matrix to simultaneously analyze CYP450 
      enzyme activities so as to simplify the sampling schemes in the phenotyping 
      protocol to enhance its throughput and feasibility in native populations or in 
      remote and underserviced geographies and social contexts. We evaluated 13 
      Ecuadorian healthy volunteers for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genotypes 
      and their metabolic phenotypes, including CYP3A4, in plasma and urine after 
      administering one reduced dose of caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, and 
      dextromethorphan. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed, and the correlation 
      between AUC parent/AUC metabolite and the ratio between concentrations of probe 
      drugs and their corresponding metabolites at timepoints ranging from 0 to 12 
      hours post-dose were analyzed. A single sampling timepoint, 4 hours post-dose in 
      plasma, was identified as optimal to reflect the metabolic activity of the 
      attendant CYP450 enzymes. This study optimizes the CEIBA multiplexed phenotyping 
      approach and offers new ways forward for integrated drug metabolism analyses, in 
      the pursuit of global personalized medicine applications in resource-limited 
      regions, be they in developed or developing countries.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and leukotriene 
      receptor antagonists on the transport of human organic anion transporter 4.
PG  - 1499-505
AB  - Human organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4) is the only member of the OAT family 
      that is expressed in the placenta and also expressed in kidney. Although OAT4 has 
      been shown to transport certain organic anions as well as other members of the 
      OAT family, fewer numbers of substrates have been identified for OAT4 compared 
      with OAT1 and OAT3, suggesting that the substrate specificity of OAT4 is greater 
      than other OAT members. However, the substrate specificity of OAT4 remains to be 
      investigated in detail. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 
      various drugs on the OAT4-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate, a typical 
      substrate of OAT4, by using human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with 
      OAT4 (HEK-OAT4). HEK-OAT4 cells exhibited concentration-dependent uptake of 
      estrone-3-sulfate, with a K(m) value of 20.9+/-3.53 microM. 
      Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and probenecid potently inhibited 
      estrone-3-sulfate uptake. We also searched for the potential inhibitors of OAT4 
      and identified candesartan, candesartan cilexetil, losartan, losartan carboxyl 
      (EXP3174) and valsartan as inhibitors of OAT4, with K(i) values of 88.9, 135.2, 
      24.8, 13.8 and 19.6 microM, respectively. The above angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists share a common structural 
      feature, that is the tetrazole group. Although pranlukast is devoid of anionic 
      motifs other than the tetrazole group, it potently inhibited the OAT4-mediated 
      uptake of estrone-3-sulfate, indicating that a tetrazole group may be one 
      important structural feature in substrate recognition by OAT4.

TI  - Influence of dietary sodium restriction on angiotensin II receptors in rat 
      adrenals.
PG  - 5238-47
AB  - We studied the distribution of angiotensin II (AII) receptors type 1 (AT1) and 
      type 2 (AT2) and the effects of a low sodium intake on these two subtypes of 
      receptors in male rat adrenals. Binding studies on adrenal slices, on cell 
      membranes and on cell suspensions were performed using [125I]AII and specific 
      analogs for AT1 (Losartan) and AT2 (PD 123319) receptors. The distribution of AT1 
      was also studied by immunofluorescence. Complementary approaches were necessary 
      to reach our goal. Indeed, by autoradiography on adrenal slices, [125I]AII was 
      shown to bind to the zona glomerulosa (ZG) and to the medulla (M). When 
      coincubated with [125I]AII, PD 123319 displaced [125I]AII from the medulla and 
      from the ZG, indicating the presence of AT2 receptors in both zones. Losartan 
      partially displaced [125I]AII from the ZG, indicating the presence of AT1 
      receptors in that zone. Furthermore, the labeling intensity of the medulla (AT2 
      receptors) was much stronger in adrenal sections from rats kept on a low sodium 
      regimen than from controls. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that AT1 
      receptors were located mainly in the ZG of control rats. After sodium 
      restriction, AT1 receptors appeared to be uniformly distributed within an 
      enlarged ZG; furthermore AT1 receptor-positive cells were found to a limited 
      degree in the zona fasciculata and possibly in the zona reticularis, and a 
      greater number of these positive cells appeared in these zones under sodium 
      restriction. Cell suspensions from rats fed a low sodium diet showed a 2.7- and 
      2.1-fold increase in total AII receptors in adrenal ZG and ZFR + M cells when 
      compared with controls. Based on Losartan displacement, we calculated that 
      [125I]AII bound to AT1 and to AT2 receptors was increased in both ZG and ZFR + M 
      cell preparations under sodium restriction. Results of binding studies on cell 
      membranes were also indicative of an increasing effect of sodium restriction on 
      AT1 and AT2 receptors binding capacity. Furthermore, Northern blotting analysis 
      revealed 3.0- and 2.5-fold increases in the level of AT1 receptor mRNA in the ZG 
      and the ZFR + M of rats fed a low sodium diet as compared with those fed a normal 
      diet. The low sodium intake resulted in a weaker increase (1.5-fold) in the level 
      of AT2 receptor messenger RNA in the ZG, with no changes in the ZFR + M 
      preparations. In conclusion, in this study complementary approaches were needed 
      to determine the localization of AT1 and AT2 receptors in the rat adrenal, and to 
      show the increasing effects of a low sodium regimen on the adrenal level of these 
      receptors. Immunofluorescence studies revealed AT1 receptors mainly in the ZG and 
      also in some cells of the inner adrenal cortex zones; in adrenals of rats kept on 
      a low sodium diet the ZG was markedly enlarged, and an increased number of 
      immunoreactive cells with AT1 receptors were observed throughout that zone; also 
      more immunoreactive cells were present in the inner zones of the adrenal cortex. 
      Furthermore in the adrenals of rats kept on a low sodium diet, we observed: 1) an 
      increased number of AT1 and AT2 receptors in cell suspensions from the ZG, and in 
      cell suspensions of the ZFR + M; 2) an increased level of AT1 and AT2 receptor 
      mRNAs in the ZG; 3) an increased level of AT1 receptor mRNA, with no changes in 
      the AT2 mRNA level in the ZFR + M. These results suggest a role for AT1 as well 
      as for AT2 receptors in controlling adrenal function and differentiation under 
      normal as well as under physiological stimulation of AII production following 
      sodium restriction.

AB  - Heterogeneity of rat brain angiotensin II receptors was revealed by quantitative 
      autoradiography after incubation with 125I-Sar1-angiotensin II and displacement 
      with the angiotensin II antagonists CGP 42112 A and DuP-753 and by receptor 
      sensitivity to dithiothreitol. Receptors in areas involved in cardiovascular and 
      fluid control--the subfornical organ, nucleus of the solitary tract, 
      paraventricular nucleus, and area postrema--are displaced by DuP-753 with an IC50 
      of 1 x 10(-7) M, are sensitive to 5 mM dithiothreitol, and thus are angiotensin 
      II type-1. Receptors in the inferior olive are displaced by CGP 42112 A (IC50, 1 
      x 10(-9) M) but not by DuP-753 in concentrations up to 10(-4) M, are insensitive 
      to 5 mM dithiothreitol, and thus are angiotensin II type-2.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced AT1 receptor upregulation enhances 
      angiotensin II-mediated cardiac fibroblast responses that favor fibrosis.
PG  - 1119-26
AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is an 
      important determinant of cardiac function. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
      (TNF-alpha) and angiotensin (Ang) II levels increase after MI and both factors 
      affect fibroblast functions. The type 1 (AT1) receptor that mediates most Ang II 
      effects is upregulated after MI in cardiac fibroblasts, and there is evidence 
      that this is caused by TNF-alpha. We sought to determine if TNF-alpha-induced AT1 
      receptor upregulation alters fibroblast responsiveness to Ang II and if this 
      effect differs from direct TNF-alpha effects on fibroblast functions. In cultured 
      neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts, TNF-alpha reduced cellular [3H]-proline 
      incorporation, increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and protein, 
      and increased TIMP-1 protein levels. In cardiac fibroblasts with 
      TNF-alpha-induced AT1 receptor upregulation, Ang II-stimulated [3H]proline 
      incorporation and TIMP-1 protein production was approximately 2-fold greater than 
      in nonpretreated fibroblasts. Angiotensin II reduced MMP-2 activity and protein 
      level only in TNF-alpha-pretreated fibroblasts. Angiotensin II effects were 
      inhibited by selective AT1 (but not AT2) receptor blockers. Thus, 
      TNF-alpha-induced AT1 receptor upregulation enhances Ang II-mediated functions 
      that favor fibrosis. These effects are mostly directionally opposite of direct 
      TNF-alpha effects on cardiac fibroblasts. Recognition of multifaceted TNF-alpha 
      effects provides new insights into post-MI ECM remodeling.

TI  - Evidence for angiotensin IV receptors in human collecting duct cells.
PG  - 1125-31
AB  - Because angiotensin II (Ang II) has been found at high concentrations in the 
      proximal tubule fluid and because tubular brush border membranes exhibit a marked 
      capacity for degrading Ang II, we thought it of interest to examine the binding 
      sites for Ang II (3-8) (referred to as Ang IV), a metabolite of Ang II, 
      downstream in the nephron. We studied the binding of [125I]-Ang IV and also of 
      [125I]-Sar1, Ala8, Ang II to SV-40 transformed human collecting duct cell (HCD) 
      membranes. No specific binding site for [125I]-Sar1, Ala8, Ang II and no Ang 
      II-dependent cytosolic calcium response could be observed. Moreover, no signal 
      for the human type I Ang II receptor (hAT1) mRNA was present in HCD cells. In 
      contrast, [125I]-Ang IV bound specifically to HCD cell membranes. Mean Kd and 
      Bmax values derived from saturation binding studies were 5.6 +/- 2.0 nM and 
      1007.6 +/- 140.2 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The rank order of affinity for 
      competitive Ang II-related peptides was: Ang IV > Ang III > Ang II > Ang II (4-8) 
      > Ang II (1-7). [125I]-Ang IV binding was not modified by nonpeptide AT1 
      (losartan) or AT2 (PD123177) antagonists. GTP gamma S and dithiotreitol did not 
      affect [125I]-Ang IV binding. Ang IV stimulated cAMP production by intact HCD 
      cells in the presence of forskolin but did not modify cGMP production or 
      cytosolic calcium concentration. Taken together, these results indicate that HCD 
      cells represent a target site for Ang IV but do not possess Ang II receptors.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptors and angiotensin II stimulation of ciliary activity in 
      human fallopian tube.
PG  - 2719-25
AB  - Using an antibody (6313/G2) directed against a specific sequence in the 
      extracellular domain of the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1), we demonstrated 
      the presence of angiotensin II (AII) receptors in human fallopian tube. 
      Immunoperoxidase staining for AT1 receptor showed positive staining in the 
      epithelium of the tubal mucosa. The intensity of staining varied depending upon 
      the hormonal status at the time of salpingectomy, being strongest in the 
      proliferative phase of the ovarian cycle and weakest after menopause. Ligand 
      binding assay confirmed that the AII receptor concentration was highest in the 
      mucosa of fallopian tubes from premenopausal women. Mucosa from the ampullary 
      segment had higher concentrations of AII receptor than the fimbrial and isthmic 
      segments in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Displacement studies 
      using specific AII receptor subtype antagonists showed that approximately 60% of 
      the total activity could be displaced by CGP42112B (type 2 specific) and 40% by 
      losartan (AT1 specific). Immunoblotting confirmed that the antibody detected a 
      protein of approximately 60 kDa. Functional studies showed that AII had a 
      stimulatory action on tubal ciliary beat frequency, but had no significant effect 
      on myosalpingseal activity. This effect was achieved at nanomolar concentrations 
      of AII; further increases in the AII concentration were without additional 
      effect. The stimulatory effect of AII was inhibited by the specific AT1 
      antagonist losartan, whereas the type 2 antagonist, CGP42112B, had no effect. The 
      data demonstrate that AII may play an important role in ovum transport and 
      fertility.

AB  - A sensitive, specific and selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
      spectrometric method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous 
      determination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma. Plasma 
      samples were prepared using protein precipitation with acetonitrile, the two 
      analytes and the internal standard losartan were separated on a reverse phase 
      C(18) column (50mmx4mm, 3microm) using water with 2.5% formic acid, methanol and 
      acetonitrile (40:45:15, v/v/v (%)) as a mobile phase (flow rate of 0.70mL/min). 
      Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide were ionized using ESI source in negative ion 
      mode, prior to detection by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode while 
      monitoring at the following transitions: m/z 296-->269 and m/z 296-->205 for 
      hydrochlorothiazide, 427-->175 for irbesartan. Linearity was demonstrated over 
      the concentration range 0.06-6.00microg/mL for irbesartan and 1.00-112.00ng/mL 
      for hydrochlorothiazide. The developed and validated method was successfully 
      applied to a bioequivalence study of irbesartan (300mg) with hydrochlorothiazide 
      (12.5mg) tablet in healthy volunteers (N=36).

TI  - Comparative study of enalapril vs. losartan on residual renal function 
      preservation in automated peritoneal dialysis. A randomized controlled study.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Residual renal function (RRF) is an important determinant of 
      mortality and morbidity in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). Recent 
      studies have shown a positive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
      (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on RRF in PD patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare enalapril and losartan for RRF preservation in automated 
      peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open label 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12 month follow-up period was conducted 
      to compare the effect of enalapril vs. losartan on RRF preservation in 60 APD 
      patients. Measurements were done at the start of the study (baseline), 3, 6, 9, 
      and 12 months. A historical control group (HCG) without treatment was included to 
      assess the natural history of RRF loss. RESULTS: RRF in the enalapril group 
      dropped from 3.65 +/- 1.6 (baseline) to 2.36 +/- 0.38 mL/min/1.73 m2 (12 months). 
      In the losartan group RRF was reduced from 4.1+/- 2.01 (baseline) to 2.54 +/- 
      0.47 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 (12 months). There were not significant differences between 
      the two groups regarding RRF at 12 months. In the HCG, RRF declined from 3.68 +/- 
      0.48 to 1.4 +/- 0.29 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 (12 months). RRF in the HCG was 
      significantly lower than RRF in the two treated groups at 12 months (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was not significant difference on RRF preservation between 
      enalapril and losartan groups. Comparing these results to those of the HCG 
      suggests that the treatment with any of the drugs is useful in preserving RRF.

TI  - [Angiotensin receptor blockers--significance for the therapy of hypertension].
PG  - 153-6
AB  - Angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARB) are equally effective but better tolerated 
      than all the other blood pressure lowering agents. The reason, why they are not 
      subscribed as first line drugs for uncomplicated hypertension, is the higher 
      price for these products. What the real difference in costs is, remains unclear 
      because calculations are missing to what extent lesser controls of therapy would 
      shift the balance in favour of the ARBs. For other indications than hypertension, 
      but often associated with that condition, be it per se or as a consequence of it, 
      the effects of the ARBs are studied in large trials these days. For some of them 
      the benefit, which has been proven for ACE inhibitors, is not yet established for 
      the ARBs, but evidence emerges that they are also useful in the treatment of 
      cardiac failure, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic and other kinds of 
      nephropathy. A large percentage of hypertensive patients can be treated 
      effectively with ARBs without considerable side effects, thus increasing 
      adherence and minimizing the necessity of safety controls.

TI  - The role of endogenous angiotensin II in the regulation of renal haemodynamics 
      and proximal fluid reabsorption in the rat.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - 1. The influence of endogenous angiotensin II (AII) on renal haemodynamics and 
      tubular function was examined by clearance and micropuncture methods in 
      anaesthetized rats during AII receptor blockade with the non-peptide antagonist 
      DuP 753 (50 micrograms kg-1 min-1 i.v.). 2. Mean arterial pressure was reduced 
      slightly (-5 +/- 2 mmHg) while filtration fraction and glomerular filtration rate 
      rose by 30% without changes in renal plasma flow (RPF) or renal vascular 
      resistance (RVR). 3. Fractional proximal fluid reabsorption (calculated from 
      lithium clearance) fell from 73 to 64% (P < 0.01) and fractional distal sodium 
      reabsorption decreased from 98 to 94% (P < 0.01). 4. Urine flow rate more than 
      doubled, sodium output increased 4-fold and plasma renin concentration rose 
      8-fold while potassium excretion remained unchanged. 5. Proximal tubular fluid 
      reabsorption (Jv) as measured by shrinking split-droplet micropuncture decreased 
      by 21% (P < 0.01) during infusion of DuP 753 compared with 22.5% (P < 0.01) 
      during converting enzyme inhibition by enalaprilat (MK422). 6. Responses to DuP 
      753 were similar to those previously documented with converting enzyme inhibitors 
      except that DuP 753 failed to raise RPF. It is concluded that generation of 
      intrarenal vasodilator paracrines has confounded conclusions about the renal 
      action of converting enzyme inhibitors and we propose that in anaesthetized rats, 
      endogenous angiotensin II (AII) has its major renal influences on glomerular 
      filtration and proximal fluid reabsorption with little effect on renal vascular 
      resistance.

TI  - Angiotensinergic pathway through the median preoptic nucleus in the control of 
      oxytocin secretion and water and sodium intake.
PG  - 236-43
AB  - Our objective was to study in which situations the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) 
      interferes with the control of oxytocin secretion and salt intake and the 
      possible mediation of angiotensin II (AII) through their AT1 receptors. Lesion of 
      the MnPO by ibotenic acid in male rats did not change water and NaCl intake in 
      conditions of ad libitum offer, water deprivation or salt load, but it did cause 
      significant decrease of NaCl intake in sodium depleted animals. These animals 
      presented higher water intake or lower NaCl intake after microinjection of AII or 
      losartan into the MnPO, respectively. They decreased plasma oxytocin after 
      microinjection of losartan into the MnPO, but not of AII or isotonic saline. 
      Oxytocin secretion induced by hypertonic saline i.p. was reduced by 
      microinjection of AII, but not losartan into the MnPO. On the other hand, 
      microinjection of losartan in this area, but not AII, reduced plasma oxytocin in 
      animals submitted to the isotonic saline i.p. Thus, it seems that the sodium 
      intake control is performed by MnPO neurons through the stimulatory action of 
      angiotensin II on AT1 receptors under sodium depletion, but not water deprivation 
      or salt overload neither of ad libitum water and salt intake condition. On the 
      other hand, in the high-sodium condition, endogenous angiotensin did not act on 
      MnPO neurons to the control of oxytocin secretion while exogenous angiotensin 
      inhibited oxytocin secretion. These results indicate two possible 
      angiotensinergic neural circuits: one is stimulating and the other is inhibiting 
      oxytocin secretion, depending on sodium balance.

TI  - Protein kinase C isoforms in rat kidney proximal tubule: acute effect of 
      angiotensin II.
PG  - C134-40
AB  - The present study examined the effect of phorbol esters, Ca2+, and angiotensin II 
      (ANG II) on protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in the rat proximal tubule. The 
      immunoblot analysis of PKC isoforms of particulate and cytosolic fractions of 
      proximal tubules revealed immunoreactive proteins when antibodies against 
      PKC-alpha, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta, but not -beta and -gamma were used. 
      Phorbol dibutyrate (PDBU) induced the translocation of PKC-alpha, -delta, and 
      -epsilon, whereas an inactive phorbol ester had no effect. PDBU and ionomycin 
      increased particulate PKC specific activity from 0.67 +/- 0.09 to 1.56 +/- 0.18 
      and 0.96 +/- 0.04 pmol.microgram protein-1.2 min-1, respectively. ANG II (10(-7) 
      M) induced a time-dependent increase in particulate PKC-alpha immunoreactivity 
      observed after 2 min and maintained for 12 min. Particulate PKC-epsilon 
      immunoreactivity increased after 4 min. Meanwhile, PKC-delta and -zeta were not 
      modified by ANG II. Accordingly, ANG II elicited a rise in the specific activity 
      of the particulate PKC, which increased to 0.89 +/- 0.09 pmol.micrograms 
      protein-1.2 min-1 after 2 min. This was inhibited by a preincubation in the 
      presence of 10(-5) M losartan, specific inhibitor of angiotensin subtype 1 
      receptors. These data indicate that PKC-alpha and -epsilon are potential 
      candidates to regulate the activity of Na+/H+ and Na(+)-HCO3- transporters 
      because they are translocated with a time course fitting with that of the 
      reported effect of ANG II on those transporters.

      irbesartan in human plasma: application to pharmacokinetic study of irbesartan.
PG  - 2353-8
LID - 10.1002/jssc.200900148 [doi]
AB  - A hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method 
      (HILIC/MS/MS) for the determination of irbesartan in human plasma was developed. 
      Irbesartan and losartan (internal standard) were extracted from human plasma with 
      ethyl acetate at acidic pH. The analytes were analyzed on a Luna HILIC column 
      with the mobile phase of ACN-ammonium formate (50 mM, pH 6.5) (96:4, v/v) and 
      detected by ESI MS/MS in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The standard 
      curve was linear (r(2) = 0.9981) over the concentration range of 10-2500 ng/mL 
      and the lower LOQ was 10 ng/mL using 100 microL of plasma sample. The CV and 
      relative error for intra- and interassay at four QC levels were 2.9 to 8.1% and 
      -2.7 to 2.3%, respectively. There were less absolute and relative matrix effects 
      for irbesartan and losartan. The present method was successfully applied to the 
      pharmacokinetic study of irbesartan after oral dose of irbesartan (150 mg tablet) 
      to male healthy volunteers.

TI  - Distribution of angiotensin II receptor subtypes in rat and human kidney.
PG  - F236-40
AB  - Angiotensin II initiates a variety of physiological effects in the kidney by 
      binding to high-affinity receptors on plasma membranes. Recently, two subtypes of 
      angiotensin II receptors have been distinguished on the basis of differences in 
      signal transduction mechanisms, binding affinity to agonists and antagonists, and 
      inhibition of binding by dithiothreitol. To evaluate the density and distribution 
      of these receptor subtypes in the kidney, we performed an in situ 
      autoradiographic study on frozen tissue sections obtained from rat and human 
      kidneys. Sections were incubated with 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II and binding 
      specificity was verified by competition with unlabeled [Sar1]angiotensin II. 
      Angiotensin II receptor subtypes were characterized by competition with the 
      nonpeptide receptor antagonists, DuP 753 (type 1) and PD123177 (type 2). Both rat 
      and human kidney exhibited a high concentration of angiotensin II receptors in 
      glomeruli and in the longitudinal bands traversing the outer portion of the 
      medulla, corresponding to the medullary vascular bundles. Binding affinity (Kd = 
      0.6 +/- 0.4 nM), determined in rat kidney, was similar to that reported 
      previously in isolated glomeruli and membrane vesicles prepared from renal 
      tubules. Angiotensin II binding was almost completely inhibited by DuP 753, 
      whereas PD123177 had little effect. Thus the predominant angiotensin II receptor 
      subtype in both rat and human kidney is type 1. The distribution of angiotensin 
      II receptors correlates well with the intrarenal sites at which the peptide has 
      its major physiological effects.

      intracerebroventricular administration of angiotensin II, inhibited drinking with 
      the following order of potency: EXP3174 > GR117289 > losartan > LR-B/081. When 20 
      mumol/kg of each antagonist was i.p. injected 15 min, 4, 12 or 24 h before 
      angiotensin II, EXP3174 and GR117289 inhibited water intake at each observation 
      time, losartan at 4, 12 and 24 h, LR-B/081 only at 4 and 12 h. After per os 
      administration of the same dose 4 or 12 h before angiotensin II, losartan reduced 
      drinking at 4, but not at 12 h; LR-B/081 did not inhibit drinking either at 4 or 
      12 h. The present results suggest that EXP3174 and GR117289 cross the barrier 
      readily. The effect of i.p. losartan on central angiotensin mechanisms is not 
      prompt, suggesting that it may require conversion to EXP3174. LR-B/081 apparently 
      crosses the barrier less readily than the other antagonists following both i.p. 
      and per os administration.

PG  - R515-23
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.1998.275.2.R515 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the precise role of angiotensin 
      subtype-1 (AT1) and -2 (AT2) receptors and the mechanisms by which they act to 
      alter fluid transport in the rat jejunum. In rats on normal sodium intake, ANG II 
      at low dose stimulated net jejunal fluid absorption, whereas at a high dose the 
      peptide inhibited absorption. Low-dose ANG II-stimulated fluid absorption was 
      blocked completely by the specific AT2 receptor antagonist PD-123319 (PD) but was 
      unchanged by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (Los). The AT2 receptor agonist 
      CGP-42112A, caused an inversely dose-dependent increase in fluid absorption, 
      which also was totally prevented by PD but was unaltered by Los. Conversely, 
      high-dose ANG II inhibition of absorption was blocked by Los but not by PD. In 
      animals receiving normal sodium intake, neither Los nor PD alone altered fluid 
      absorption. In sodium-restricted animals, however, Los alone increased absorption 
      and PD alone inhibited absorption. In rats on normal sodium intake, low-dose ANG 
      II increased jejunal interstitial and luminal (loop) fluid concentrations of 
      cGMP. These increases in cGMP were blocked with PD but not with Los. 
      8-Bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate administered via the mesenteric 
      artery or the submucosal interstitial space markedly increased absorption, but it 
      inhibited absorption when administered into the loop. High-dose ANG II decreased 
      jejunal interstitial and loop fluid cAMP and increased PGE2. The increase in PGE2 
      was blocked by Los but not by PD. The data demonstrate that ANG II mediates 
      jejunal sodium and water absorption by an action at the AT2 receptor involving 
      cGMP formation. The data also show that ANG II inhibits absorption via the AT1 
      receptor by a mechanism that is both negatively coupled to cAMP and increases 
      jejunal PGE2 production.

TI  - Renal uptake of circulating angiotensin II in Val5-angiotensin II infused rats is 
      mediated by AT1 receptor.
PG  - 570-8
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that augmentation of intrarenal angiotensin II 
      (ANG II) levels during ANG II induced hypertension involves both endogenous 
      formation and accumulation of circulating ANG II. The present work extends these 
      findings and determines whether accumulation of infused ANG II in the kidney 
      requires AT1 receptor activation by using Val5-ANG II as the infused peptide. 
      Male Sprague-Dawley rats were uninephrectomized and divided into three groups: 
      control (n = 6), Val5-ANG II (exogenous form) infused (n = 8), and Val5-ANG II 
      infused rats treated with losartan (n = 8). Val5-ANG II, which has the same 
      biological and immunoreactive properties as endogenous ANG II, was infused at 40 
      ng/min via an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously. By day 12, systolic 
      blood pressure (SBP) increased significantly in Val5-ANG II infused rats (197 +/- 
      7 mm Hg). As previously shown, the development of hypertension in ANG II infused 
      rats was prevented by losartan treatment. Blood and kidney samples were 
      harvested, subjected to HPLC to separate Val5-ANG II (exogenous) from Ile5-ANG II 
      (endogenous) and the fractions were measured by radioimmunoassay. In the Val5-ANG 
      II infused rats treated with losartan, total plasma ANG II levels were elevated 
      to a greater extent than in rats not treated with losartan (289 +/- 20 v 119 +/- 
      14 fmol/mL). However, losartan markedly decreased by 88% the enhancement of 
      intrarenal Val5-ANG II content that occurred in the rats infused with Val5-ANG II 
      alone. These results demonstrate that AT1 receptor blockade markedly reduces the 
      intrarenal uptake of circulating ANG II that occurs in ANG II induced 
      hypertension.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potency of LC-MS/MS by means of sensitivity and the 
      applicability for cassette dosing in microdose clinical trials. METHODS: Thirty 
      one top-selling 31 drugs were spiked to human plasma, extracted, and analyzed by 
      LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The lower limits of quantification for each drug varied from 
      0.08 to 50 pg/mL, and were lower than one eighth of the assumed maximum plasma 
      concentration at microdose in all drugs except for losartan, indicating the high 
      performance in acquisition of full pharmacokinetic profiles at microdose. We also 
      succeeded in simultaneous analysis of multiple compounds, assuming a situation of 
      cassette dosing in which multiple drug candidates would be administrated 
      simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the features of LC-MS/MS, such as 
      immediate verification, the utilization of non-radiolabeled drugs and no special 
      facilities, we suppose that LC-MS/MS analysis would be widely applicable in 
      conducting microdose clinical studies.

TI  - A high-throughput assay using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 
      simultaneous in vivo phenotyping of 5 major cytochrome p450 enzymes in patients.
PG  - 239-46
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318197e1bf [doi]
AB  - The phenotyping cocktail is a practical approach for phenotyping of cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) enzymes in vivo. In this study, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry method using a dual-extraction approach was developed and validated 
      to quantify 5 selective substrates and their metabolites for the simultaneous 
      phenotyping CYPs 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 in patient blood samples. The assay 
      was applied in a pilot study of 11 patients with schizophrenia. Five blood 
      samples were collected before and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration of 
      a phenotyping cocktail consisting of 100 mg caffeine, 20 mg omeprazole, 25 mg 
      losartan, 30 mg dextromethorphan, and 2 mg midazolam. The method successfully 
      quantitated the CYP enzyme activities without serious side effects in patients. 
      The ratios of metabolite to parent area under the concentration-time curve values 
      were calculated over the 6-hour postdosage to reflect CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 
      activities. The ratios of metabolite to parent plasma concentrations were 
      calculated at 4-hour postdosage for CYP1A2 and at 4- or 6-hour postdose for 
      CYP2C19, respectively. The plasma concentration of midazolam at 4 hours was also 
      estimated as another phenotyping index for CYP3A4 activity. The simultaneous 
      assay of all these analytes in a single matrix (plasma) will increase the 
      feasibility of CYP phenotyping in patients.

TI  - Release modulating hydrophilic matrix systems of losartan potassium: optimization 
      of formulation using statistical experimental design.
PG  - 73-82
AB  - The aim of the present research work was to systemically device a model of 
      factors that would yield an optimized sustained release dosage form of an 
      anti-hypertensive agent, losartan potassium, using response surface methodology 
      by employing a 3-factor, 3-level Box-Behnken statistical design. Independent 
      variables studied were the amount of the release retardant polymers - HPMC K15M 
      (X(1)), HPMC K100M (X(2)) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (X(3)). The 
      dependent variables were the burst release in 15 min (Y(1)), cumulative 
      percentage release of drug after 60 min (Y(2)) and hardness (Y(3)) of the tablets 
      with constraints on the Y(2)=31-35%. Statistical validity of the polynomials was 
      established. In vitro release and swelling studies were carried out for the 
      optimized formulation and the data were fitted to kinetic equations. The 
      polynomial mathematical relationship obtained 
      Y(2)=32.91-2.30X(1)-5.69X(2)-0.97X(3)-0.41X(1)X(2)+0.21X(1)X(3)-0.92X(1)(2)-1.89X(2)(2) 
      (r(2)=0.9944) explained the main and quadratic effects, and the interactions of 
      factors influencing the drug release from matrix tablets. The adjusted (0.9842) 
      and predicted values (0.9893) of r(2) for Y(2) were in close agreement. 
      Validation of the optimization study indicated high degree of prognostic ability 
      of response surface methodology. Tablets showed an initial burst release 
      preceding a more gradual sustained release phase following a non-fickian 
      diffusion process. The Box-Behnken experimental design facilitated the 
      formulation and optimization of sustained release hydrophilic matrix systems of 
      losartan potassium.

TI  - K depletion stimulates in vivo HCO3 reabsorption in surviving rat distal tubules.
PG  - F665-72
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.1998.274.4.F665 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate whether K depletion enhances in vivo bicarbonate reabsorption (JtCO2) 
      in surviving distal tubules (DT), we compared DT JtCO2 in five-sixths 
      nephrectomized rats (Nx) with and without dietary K depletion (Nx-K). 
      Furthermore, to identify possible mechanisms of increased JtCO2, we perfused 
      inhibitors of proton secretion in both Nx and Nx-K rats. JtCO2 (102 +/- 8 
      pmol.min-1.mm-1) was significantly increased in Nx-K vs. Nx rats (65 +/- 7 
      pmol.min-1.mm-1, P < 0.05) but unaffected by 10(-6) M losartan perfusion (94 +/- 
      6 pmol.min-1.mm-1, P = not significant). Although 10(-5) M Sch-28080 also had no 
      significant effect, 5 x 10(-9) M concanamycin A perfusion significantly decreased 
      JtCO2 in Nx-K rats to 65 +/- 8 pmol.min-1. mm-1 (P < 0.05). Morphometric 
      evaluation and H(+)-ATPase immunogold labeling of Nx-K A-type intercalated cells 
      revealed cellular hypertrophy, elaborated apical microplicae, and enhanced 
      H(+)-ATPase apical polarization. Accordingly, these combined studies confirm that 
      K depletion enhances JtCO2 in surviving DT by stimulating H(+)-ATPase activity, 
      independent of the AT1 receptor.

TI  - Hypertension in obese Zucker rats. Role of angiotensin II and adrenergic 
      activity.
PG  - 1047-54
AB  - We designed our studies to determine whether blood pressure is elevated in obese 
      Zucker rats compared with lean control rats and to test the importance of the 
      renin-angiotensin and adrenergic nervous systems in long-term blood pressure 
      control in this genetic model of obesity. We monitored mean arterial pressure 24 
      hours per day using computerized methods in 13- to 14-week-old lean and obese 
      Zucker rats maintained on a fixed, normal sodium intake (3.3 mmol/d). Mean 
      arterial pressure (average of 5 days) was higher in obese (100 +/- 1 mm Hg) than 
      in lean (86 +/- 1) rats. Although control plasma renin activity was lower in 
      obese than in lean rats (3.66 +/- 0.15 versus 5.48 +/- 0.11 ng angiotensin I/mL 
      per hour), blood pressure sensitivity to exogenous angiotensin II was greater in 
      obese than in lean rats. Blockade of endogenous angiotensin II receptors with 
      losartan (10 mg/kg per day) for 7 days also caused a greater decrease in blood 
      pressure in obese (36 +/- 2 mm Hg, n = 6) than in lean (25 +/- 1, n = 5) rats. 
      However, combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade with terazosin (10 mg/kg 
      per day) and propranolol (10 mg/kg per day), respectively, for 8 days caused only 
      modest decreases in blood pressure in obese (9 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8) and lean (4 
      +/- 2, n = 6) rats, despite effective alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. These 
      results suggest that increased arterial pressure in obese Zucker rats depends in 
      part on angiotensin II. However, additional mechanisms may also contribute to 
      increased blood pressure in obese Zucker rats.

TI  - Effect of luminal angiotensin II and ANP on early and late cortical distal tubule 
      HCO3- reabsorption.
PG  - F977-84
AB  - Bicarbonate reabsorption was evaluated by stationary microperfusion "in vivo" 
      early distal (ED) and late distal (LD) segments of at kidney. Intratubular pH was 
      recorded by double-barreled of H+ exchange resin/reference (1 M KCl) 
      microelectrodes for the determination of HCO3- reabsorption. In the presence of 
      angiotensin II (ANG II) (10(-12) M), a significant increase in HCO3- reabsorption 
      was observed both in ED (from 0.930 +/- 0.060 to 2.64 +/- 0.210 nmol.cm-2.s-1 in 
      luminally perfused tubules and from 0.850 +/- 0.040 to 2.03 +/- 0.210 
      nmol.cm-2.s-1 during capillary perfusion) and LD segments from 0.310 +/- 0.130 to 
      2.16 +/- 0.151 nmol.cm-2.s-1 during luminal perfusion and from 0.530 +/- 0.031 to 
      2.16 +/- 0.211 nmol.cm-2.s-1 with capillary perfusion). The addition of the 
      AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (10(-6) M) to luminal perfusion blocked luminal 
      ANG II-mediated stimulation in ED and LD segments. 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride 
      (10(-4) M) added to luminal perfusion inhibited luminal ANG II-mediated 
      stimulation in ED (by 81%) and LD (by 54%) segments. The addition of bafilomycin 
      A1 (2 x 10(-7) M) to luminal perfusion does not affect luminal ANG II-mediated 
      stimulation in ED segments but reduces it in LD segments (by 33%). During the 
      addition of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (10(-6) M) or ANG II plus ANP in 
      both segments, no significant differences in HCO3- reabsorption were observed. 
      Our results indicate that luminal ANG II acts to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange in ED 
      and LD segments via activation of AT1 receptors, as well as the vacuolar 
      H(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase in LD segments. ANP does not affect HCO3- 
      reabsorption in either ED or LD segments and does not impair the stimulation 
      caused by ANG II.

TI  - Pharmacological profile of valsartan: a potent, orally active, nonpeptide 
      antagonist of the angiotensin II AT1-receptor subtype.
PG  - 761-71
AB  - 1. The pharmacological profile of valsartan, 
      (S)-N-valeryl-N-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]-methyl)-vali ne, a potent, 
      highly selective, and orally active antagonist at the angiotensin II (AII) 
      AT1-receptor, was studied in vitro and in vivo. 2. Valsartan competed with 
      [125I]-AII at its specific binding sites in rat aortic smooth muscle cell 
      membranes (AT1-receptor subtype) with a Ki of 2.38 nM, but was about 30,000 times 
      less active in human myometrial membranes (AT2-receptor subtype). 3. In rabbit 
      aortic rings incubated for 5 min with valsartan, at concentrations of 2, 20 and 
      200 nM, the concentration-response curve of AII was displaced to the right and 
      the maximum response was reduced by 33%, 36% and 40%, respectively. Prolongation 
      of the incubation time with valsartan to 1 h or 3 h, further reduced the maximum 
      response by 48% or 59% (after 20 nM) and by 59% or 60% (after 200 nM) 
      respectively. After 3 h incubation an apparent pKb value of 9.26 was calculated. 
      Contractions induced by noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or potassium chloride 
      were not affected by valsartan. No agonistic effects were observed in the rabbit 
      aorta at concentrations of valsartan up to 2 microM. 4. In bovine adrenal 
      glomerulosa, valsartan inhibited AII-stimulated aldosterone release without 
      affecting the maximum response (pA2 8.4). 5. In the pithed rat, oral 
      administration of valsartan (10 mg kg-1) shifted the AII-induced pressor response 
      curves to the right, without affecting responses induced by the electrical 
      stimulation of the sympathetic outflow or by noradrenaline. Animals treated with 
      valsartan 24 h before pithing also showed significant inhibition of the response 
      to AII. 6. In conscious, two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K1C), 
      valsartan decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after single i.v. 
      or oral administration. The respective ED30 values were 0.06 mg kg-1 (i.v.) and 
      1.4 mg kg-1 (p.o.). The antihypertensive effect lasted for at least 24 h after 
      either route of administration. After repeated oral administration for 4 days (3 
      and 10 mg kg-1 daily), in 2K1C renal hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure 
      was consistently decreased, but heart rate was not significantly affected. 7. In 
      conscious, normotensive, sodium-depleted marmosets, valsartan decreased mean 
      arterial pressure, measured by telemetry, after oral doses of 1-30 mg kg-1. The 
      hypotensive effect persisted up to 12 h after 3 and 10 mg kg-1 and up to 24 h 
      after 30 mg kg-1. 8. In sodium-depleted marmosets, the hypotensive effect of 
      valsartan lasted longer than that of losartan(DuP 753). In renal hypertensive 
      rats, both agents had a similar duration (24 h), but a different onset of action 
      (valsartan at 1 h, losartan between 2 h and 24 h).9. These results demonstrate 
      that valsartan is a potent, specific, highly selective antagonist of AII at 
      theAT1-receptor subtype and does not possess agonistic activity. Furthermore, it 
      is an efficacious, orally active, blood pressure-lowering agent in conscious 
      renal hypertensive rats and in conscious normotensive,sodium-depleted primates.

TI  - Drug interactions with the potential to prevent prodrug activation as a common 
      source of irrational prescribing in hospital inpatients.
PG  - 639-47
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the frequency of potential drug-drug 
      interactions between the prodrugs losartan, codeine, and tramadol and drugs known 
      to inhibit their activation in hospitalized patients. METHODS: The frequency of 
      coadministration between losartan and well-established cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 
      inhibitors, as well as codeine and tramadol and CYP2D6 inhibitors, was studied by 
      use of data from a university hospital medication database. The study population 
      comprised all patients treated in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, 
      oncology, and neurology wards (105,533 treatment periods and 65,526 patients) 
      between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 2002 (6 years). RESULTS: Every fifth patient 
      receiving losartan, codeine, or tramadol was concomitantly taking another drug 
      that has the potential to inhibit the activation of these drugs. During the 
      6-year time period, 1999 patients were exposed to a potential interaction. 
      Interactions occurred more commonly in internal medicine wards (odds ratio, 2.3; 
      95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.5) and in women (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.4-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of drugs that potentially 
      result in inhibition of prodrug activation present a common and unrecognized 
      source of irrational prescribing.

TI  - Brief losartan treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats abates 
      long-term blood pressure elevation by effects on renal vascular structure.
PG  - 1413-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the importance of regional vascular structural changes for 
      the long-term antihypertensive effect of brief angiotensin II receptor blockade 
      with losartan in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). DESIGN/METHODS: 
      SHRs were treated from 3 to 8 weeks of age with losartan (SHRLos, 30 mg/kg per 
      day in drinking water) or vehicle (SHRCon). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) 
      was measured using a telemetric technique from 12 to 25 weeks of age. Indices of 
      vascular structure in the renal and hindquarter limb (HQ) were assessed using a 
      haemodynamic perfusion technique at 13-15 weeks of age. RESULTS: MAP in SHRLos 
      was reduced by 20-30 mmHg throughout the study (P < 0.001) and left ventricular 
      weights were reduced (P < 0.05). The slope of the pressure/flow relationship was 
      significantly changed (P < 0.001) in both kidneys and HQ vascular beds, 
      suggesting greater average lumen dimensions in SHRLos. Pressure-glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) curves of SHRLos kidneys were shifted to the left (P < 
      0.001), suggesting that the reduction in renal vascular resistance was 
      predominantly preglomerular. The changes in structural indices of the heart and 
      HQ closely followed the reduction in MAP. However, resistance at maximal 
      dilatation in SHRLos kidneys was changed out of proportion to the lowering in MAP 
      (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Brief losartan treatment in young SHRs reduces long-term 
      MAP. The reduced MAP is associated with higher average renal and skeletal muscle 
      vascular dimensions at maximal dilatation, predominantly in the pre-capillary 
      vasculature. The reduction in vascular resistance of the kidney appears to be out 
      of proportion to the reduction in MAP and it may be speculated that this is of 
      primary importance in the long-term hypotensive effect of brief angiotensin II 
      antagonism in SHRs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deep penetration of large-sized drug nanocarriers into tumors is 
      important to improve the efficacy of tumor therapy. METHODS: In this study, we 
      developed a size-changeable "Trojan Horse" nanocarrier (THNC) composed of 
      paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded Greek soldiers (GSs; ~20 nm) assembled in an amphiphilic 
      gelatin matrix with hydrophilic losartan (LST) added. RESULTS: With amphiphilic 
      gelatin matrix cleavage by matrix metalloproteinase-2, LST showed fast release of 
      up to 60% accumulated drug at 6 h, but a slow release kinetic (~20%) was detected 
      in the PTX from the GSs, indicating that THNCs enable controllable release of LST 
      and PTX drugs for penetration into the tumor tissue. The in vitro cell viability 
      in a 3D tumor spheroid model indicated that the PTX-loaded GSs liberated from 
      THNCs showed deeper penetration as well as higher cytotoxicity, reducing a tumor 
      spheroid to half its original size and collapsing the structure of the tumor 
      microenvironment. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the THNCs with 
      controlled drug release and deep penetration of magnetic GSs show great potential 
      for cancer therapy.

TI  - Development of a high throughput equilibrium dialysis method.
PG  - 580-87
AB  - The identification of large numbers of biologically active chemical entities 
      during high throughput screening (HTS) necessitates the incorporation of new 
      strategies to identify compounds with drug-like properties early during the lead 
      prioritization and development processes. One of the major steps in lead 
      prioritization is an assessment of compound binding to plasma proteins, because 
      it affects both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compound in 
      vivo. Equilibrium dialysis is the preferred method to determine the free drug 
      fraction, because it is less susceptible to experimental artifacts. However, even 
      low-volume standard equilibrium dialysis is currently not amenable to the HTS 
      format. Those considerations dictate the development of a high throughput 
      equilibrium dialysis device, without compromising the analytical quality of the 
      data. The present paper demonstrates successful development of a 96-well format 
      equilibrium dialysis plate. Plasma protein binding of three drugs, propranolol, 
      paroxetine, and losartan, with low, intermediate, and high binding properties, 
      respectively, were chosen for assay validation. The data indicate that the 
      apparent free fraction obtained by this method correlates with the published 
      values determined by the traditional equilibrium dialysis techniques.

TI  - Identification of a novel non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in the rat 
      brain.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Efforts to protect radiolabeled angiotensins from metabolism during receptor 
      binding assays date back more than 30 years. However, this continues to be a 
      problem. This study focused on the effects of a protease inhibitor, 
      p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), on the binding of (125)I-Ang II to rat brain 
      membranes. Addition of PCMB to the incubation medium revealed a high affinity 
      binding site for (125)I-Ang II in brain membranes (K(d)=1-4 nM) with a greater 
      amount of binding than revealed in previous studies of brain Ang II receptors. 
      Further characterization of this binding, revealed it to be insensitive to 
      inhibition by losartan (an AT(1) receptor antagonist) and PD123319 (an AT(2) 
      receptor antagonist). This non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site was not present in liver 
      or adrenal membranes. It was activated by a limited range of concentrations of 
      PCMB, with maximal activation at 0.3-1 mM. This binding site was equally abundant 
      in cerebral cortex (a brain region with few Ang II receptors) and the 
      hypothalamus (a brain region with abundant Ang II receptors). The binding site 
      was also present in mouse brain, but not mouse liver. The binding site shows high 
      affinity for Ang I, Ang II and Ang III (K(i) approximately 40-100 nM), but lesser 
      affinity for smaller angiotensin fragments and other neuropeptides. This binding 
      site shares some characteristics with the liver cytosolic Ang II binding 
      proteins, later identified as endopeptidases EC 3.4.24.15 and/or EC 3.4.24.16. 
      However, some unique characteristics of this non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site 
      suggest that it may be a novel angiotensin binding substance.

PG  - F595-600
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.1997.273.4.F595 [doi]
AB  - The present in vitro microperfusion study examined the effect of luminal 
      angiotensin II on proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) volume absorption and 
      bicarbonate transport. Neither 10(-11) M, 10(-10) M, nor 2 x 10(-8) M luminal 
      angiotensin II significantly affected PCT transport. When tubules were first 
      perfused with enalaprilat to inhibit endogenous angiotensin II production, 
      addition of 10(-10) M luminal angiotensin II increased volume absorption (0.72 
      +/- 0.08 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.07 nl x mm(-1) xmin(-1), P < 0.01) and bicarbonate 
      transport (52.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 67.9 +/- 4.2 pmol x mm(-1) min(-1), P < 0.01). 
      Addition of 10(-6) M losartan, an AT1 inhibitor, to the luminal perfusate 
      inhibited volume absorption (0.95 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.72 +/- 0.11 nl x mm(-1) x 
      min(-1), P < 0.05) and bicarbonate transport (65.0 +/- 7.3 vs. 54.7 +/- 9.2 pmol 
      x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05). Addition of 10(-4) M luminal PD-123319, an AT2 
      inhibitor, was without effect. In tubules perfused with 10(-4) M luminal 
      enalaprilat and 10(-4) M luminal PD-123319, addition of 10(-10) M luminal 
      angiotensin II in the experimental period resulted in a stimulation in volume 
      absorption (0.61 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.10 nl x mm(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.01) and 
      bicarbonate transport (49.9 +/- 6.3 vs. 77.4 +/- 14.3 pmol x mm(-1) x min(-1), P 
      < 0.01). In tubules perfused with 10(-6) M losartan and 10(-4) M enalaprilat, 
      addition of luminal 10(-10) M angiotensin II resulted in no change in transport. 
      These data are consistent with endogenous angiotensin II affecting PCT 
      bicarbonate transport in vitro via luminal AT1 receptors.

TI  - A rapid and simple LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous evaluation of CYP1A2, 
      CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 hydroxylation capacity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The analytical method here reported for the CEIBA cocktail approach 
      has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of several 
      probe drugs and their corresponding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-specific 
      metabolites in just one analysis. This methodology has been proposed in order to 
      overcome some drawbacks concerning the complexity and low throughput of 
      analytical methodologies associated with previously proposed cocktail approaches. 
      METHODS & RESULTS: Caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), 
      dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and their corresponding metabolites were all 
      analyzed in a single analytical run by gradient LC coupled to MS/MS. Sample 
      preparation was conducted with solid-phase extraction. This method was fully 
      validated and applied to CYP450 enzyme phenotyping of 20 healthy volunteers. 
      CONCLUSION: This method constitutes a rapid and simplified analytical tool to be 
      used with the CEIBA cocktail approach for the main CYP450 enzymes phenotyping.

TI  - Localization of angiotensin II type 1 receptor subtype mRNA in rat kidney.
PG  - F220-6
AB  - The physiological effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) on the kidney are mediated 
      primarily by the ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor. Two highly similar AT1 receptor 
      subtypes have been identified in the rat by molecular cloning techniques, namely 
      AT1A and AT1B. The intrarenal localization of the AT1A and AT1B receptor subtypes 
      has not been studied by hybridization methods with subtype-specific receptor 
      probes. Using radiolabeled probes from the 3' noncoding region of the AT1A and 
      AT1B cDNAs, we localized AT1 mRNA in rat kidney by in situ hybridization. 
      Specificity of the 3' noncoding region probes was tested by Northern blot and 
      solution hybridization methods. AT1A mRNA levels were highest in the liver, 
      kidney, and adrenal. In contrast, AT1B mRNA levels were highest in the adrenal 
      and pituitary and low in kidney. Autoradiographic localization of 
      125I-[Sar1,Ile8]ANG II binding indicated that the highest levels of AT1 receptors 
      were found in glomeruli and vascular elements. In situ hybridization with a 
      nonselective AT1 receptor riboprobe indicated that the highest levels of AT1 mRNA 
      were in the outer medullary vasa recta and cortical glomeruli with additional 
      diffuse labeling of the cortex and outer medulla, consistent with labeling of 
      tubular elements. In contrast, in situ hybridization with the AT1 subtype 
      selective probes revealed that AT1A receptor mRNA was primarily localized to the 
      vasa recta and diffusely to the outer stripe of the outer medulla and the renal 
      cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Interaction of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers with P-gp substrates in 
      Caco-2 cells and hMDR1-expressing membranes.
PG  - 52-8
LID - 10.1016/j.lfs.2009.11.006 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The inhibitory effect of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) on 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was examined to evaluate their clinical drug-drug 
      interaction (DDI) potential. MAIN METHODS: We performed an inhibition study on 
      the vectorial transport of digoxin, a typical substrate for P-gp, using a human 
      colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2 cells, and verapamil-stimulated ATPase 
      activity using human multidrug resistance 1 (hMDR1)-expressing membrane. KEY 
      FINDINGS: The vectorial transport of digoxin was inhibited by candesartan 
      cilexetil, irbesartan and telmisartan with the IC(50) values of 14.7, 34.0 and 
      2.19microM, respectively. Those values were 7.4-426-fold higher than their 
      theoretical clinical gastrointestinal concentration [I] at doses in clinical DDI 
      studies. Other ARBs failed to show interaction with P-gp. SIGNIFICANCE: It was 
      demonstrated that candesartan cilexetil, irbesartan and telmisartan had the 
      potential to inhibit the transport of various drugs via P-gp. Telmisartan, which 
      caused an increase in the serum digoxin concentration in humans, had a 
      sufficiently high [I]/IC(50) value, suggesting that DDI between digoxin and 
      telmisartan was caused by the inhibition of digoxin efflux via intestinal P-gp.

TI  - Drug concentration response relationships in normal volunteers after oral 
      administration of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
PG  - 513-21
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plasma 
      concentrations of losartan, an orally active angiotensin II inhibitor, its active 
      metabolite EXP3174, and angiotensin II blockade. Six healthy subjects received 
      single oral doses of 40, 80, or 120 mg losartan and placebo at 1-week intervals 
      in a crossover study. Angiotensin II blockade was assessed by the blood pressure 
      response to exogenous angiotensin II before and after losartan administration. 
      EXP3174 reached higher plasma concentrations and was eliminated more slowly than 
      its parent compound; its levels paralleled the profile of angiotensin II blockade 
      closer than losartan. Inhibition of the pressure response was dose dependent. The 
      Hill-shaped relationship between response and EXP3174 concentration (or 
      time-integrated variables) approached a plateau with 80 mg. The dose-dependent 
      increase in plasma renin and angiotensin II exhibited a considerable individual 
      scatter. We conclude that losartan produces a dose-dependent, effective 
      angiotensin II blockade that is largely determined by the active metabolite 
      EXP3174.

PG  - 350S-353S
AB  - We assessed the inhibitory effect of DuP 753, an orally active angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonist, on the pressor action of exogenous angiotensin I and II in 
      healthy volunteers. In a single dose study, doses of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg of 
      DuP 753 or placebo were tested serially at one week intervals. In the multiple 
      dose study, the administration of placebo or DuP 735 (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg, per os 
      once daily) for eight consecutive days was evaluated. The blood pressure response 
      to angiotensin I and II was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion with a blocking 
      effect still present 24 h post drug. DuP 753 also induced a dose-dependent 
      compensatory rise in plasma renin. This new compound was well tolerated by these 
      normal volunteers. Thus, DuP 753 appears to be a well tolerated, orally active, 
      potent and long-lasting antagonist of angiotensin II in humans.

AB  - Angiotensin II receptor antagonists lower blood pressure by blocking the final 
      step in the renin pathway, whereas ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II 
      production. ACE inhibitors also block kinin degradation, which may alter both 
      efficacy and side-effects. Irbesartan, one of the newer receptor antagonists, has 
      confirmed their tolerability and shown similar dose-related efficacy to other 
      major classes.

TI  - Losartan prevents contractile dysfunction in rat myocardium after left 
      ventricular myocardial infarction.
PG  - H2150-8
AB  - We studied the effects of chronic losartan (Los) treatment on contractile 
      function of isolated right ventricular (RV) trabeculae from rat hearts 12 wk 
      after left ventricular (LV) myocardial infarction (MI) had been induced by 
      ligation of the left anterior descending artery at 4 wk of age. After recovery, 
      one-half of the animals were started on Los treatment (MI+Los; 30 mg x kg(-1) x 
      day(-1) per os); the remaining animals were not treated (MI group). Rats without 
      infarction or Los treatment served as controls (Con group). MI resulted in 
      increases in LV and RV weight and unstressed LV cavity diameter; these were 
      partially prevented by Los treatment. The active peak twitch force-sarcomere 
      length relation was depressed in MI compared with either Con or MI+Los. Likewise, 
      maximum Ca2+ saturated twitch force was depressed in MI, whereas twitch 
      relaxation and twitch duration were prolonged. Myofilament function, as measured 
      in skinned trabeculae, was not significantly different among the Con, MI, and 
      MI+Los groups. We conclude that Los prevents contractile dysfunction in rat RV 
      trabeculae after LV MI. Our results suggest that the beneficiary effect of Los 
      treatment results not from improved myofilament function but rather from improved 
      myocyte Ca2+ homeostasis.

TI  - Effects of structural modifications on the intestinal permeability of angiotensin 
      II receptor antagonists and the correlation of in vitro, in situ, and in vivo 
      absorption.
PG  - 227-33
AB  - PURPOSE: The effects of structural modifications on the membrane permeability of 
      angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists and the usefulness of in vitro and 
      in situ intestinal absorption models in predicting in vivo absorption or 
      bioavailability were investigated. METHODS: Intestinal permeability was 
      determined in vitro using Caco-2 cell monolayers and in situ using a perfused rat 
      intestine method. Several physicochemical parameters were either measured or 
      computed, and correlated with intestinal permeation. RESULTS: Permeation 
      coefficients (Pa) across Caco-2 cell monolayers correlated well with both in situ 
      absorption rate constants (ka) and in vivo bioavailability or % absorption. For 
      these Ang II antagonists, Pa values larger than 3 x 10(-6) cm sec-1 and in situ 
      ka values of 2 x 10(-4) min-1 cm-1 or above were associated with good in vivo 
      absorption. Structural modifications at the R5 position, where a COOH group was 
      substituted with either a CHO or CH2OH group, enhanced the permeability of the 
      Ang II receptor antagonists up to 100-fold. There were good correlations between 
      permeability and log P(octanol/buffer), log PHPLC, charge, solvation/desolvation 
      energy and assigned hydrogen bonding potential. CONCLUSIONS: The correlations 
      obtained in this study indicate that both the Caco-2 cell model and the in situ 
      perfused rat intestine could be used to predict intestinal absorption in vivo. 
      Structural modifications of the Ang II antagonists had a significant impact on 
      the intestinal permeability. Charge, solvation energy, and hydrogen bonding are 
      predominant determinants of intestinal permeability and oral bioavailability of 
      these compounds.

TI  - A comprehensive account on the role of efflux transporters in the 
      gastrointestinal absorption of 13 commonly used substrate drugs in humans.
PG  - 93-101
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential absorption-limiting effect of intestinal efflux 
      transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been well recognized, primarily 
      based on results of numerous Caco-2 cell studies showing that flux, permeability, 
      or transport clearance of drugs from the basolateral to the apical (B --> A) 
      compartment is greater than that from the apical to the basolateral (A --> B) 
      compartment. Except for very limited examples such as celiprolol, talinolol, 
      pafenolol and paclitaxel, the potential clinical impact of these transporters on 
      oral absorption of the vast number of commonly prescribed drug substrates in 
      humans has not been closely examined to date. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether 
      these efflux transporters may play a significant role in limiting oral absorption 
      of 13 commonly used drugs (digoxin, etoposide, felodipine, fexofenadine, 
      furosemide, indinavir, losartan, nadolol, propranolol, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
      tacrolimus, and verapamil) in humans. METHODS: Drug absorption properties such as 
      the rate (as judged by the Cmax and tmax) and extent (as judged by AUC or urinary 
      excretion of drugs) of absorption as a function of dose, as well as the 
      completeness of oral absorption were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: The 
      absorption properties of these 13 drugs are not consistent with 
      absorption-retarding expectations from in vitro studies because they all show 
      apparent dose-independent kinetics in absorption or bioavailability and 
      completeness of oral absorption is shown for most of the drugs evaluated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In spite of being substrates of intestinal efflux transporters such 
      as P-gp, the in vivo oral absorption of 13 drugs examined apparently is not 
      significantly impeded by efflux transporters. Thus, there may exist an apparent 
      discrepancy between in vitro "expectations" and in vivo results; potential 
      reasons for this are discussed. The present findings, however, do not 
      de-emphasize potential in vivo importance of efflux transporters in affecting 
      (increasing or decreasing) oral absorption of certain substrate drugs, especially 
      those with low to moderate intestinal permeability and with low therapeutic 
      index, or the importance of efflux transporters in the study of mechanisms of 
      drug absorption and some potentially clinically significant drug-drug and 
      drug-food interactions.

TI  - Prolonged angiotensin II antagonism in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 
      Hemodynamic and biochemical consequences.
PG  - 278-88
AB  - The present study examines the effects of prolonged angiotensin II antagonism in 
      spontaneously hypertensive rats by using an angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      (DuP 753) that is devoid of agonistic properties and selective for the subtype 1 
      of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptor. The antihypertensive effects of DuP 753 and 
      its effects on circulating parameters of the renin-angiotensin system were 
      compared with those of a converting enzyme inhibitor (benazeprilat). To minimize 
      any influence of differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of the two 
      blockers, administration was by continuous intravenous infusion. The experiments 
      were performed in conscious, freely moving rats with continuous 24-hour 
      monitoring of blood pressure. DuP 753 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) lowered mean arterial 
      pressure to the same extent as benazeprilat (3 or 10 mg/kg/day) during a 48-hour 
      period. The antihypertensive effect was sustained when the treatment was extended 
      to 7 days (DuP 753, 10 mg/kg/day; benazeprilat, 3 mg/kg/day). Neither of the 
      compounds affected the baseline or diurnal rhythm of heart rate. Plasma 
      concentrations of renin and angiotensin II were increased sevenfold and 10-fold, 
      respectively, in the rats treated with DuP 753. In rats treated with 
      benazeprilat, plasma renin concentration increased threefold, whereas angiotensin 
      II was unchanged. Heart weights were significantly reduced to a similar extent by 
      DuP 753 and benazeprilat. Both compounds also induced a smaller but significant 
      decrease in blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Our results indicate that the 
      antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats are mainly due to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. 
      In this rat model, angiotensin II appears to play an important role in the 
      maintenance of hypertension that is mediated via the AT1 receptor.

TI  - Autoradiographic localization of subtypes of angiotensin II antagonist binding in 
      the rat brain.
PG  - 501-14
AB  - The non-peptide angiotensin II receptor compounds DuP 753 and WL 19 were utilized 
      to detect subtypes of [125I]Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II binding to angiotensin II 
      receptors in the rat brain. In rat forebrain homogenates, DuP 753 and WL 19 
      produced a partial displacement of [125I]Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II binding with 
      DuP 753 displacing approximately 65% of the binding and WL 19 displacing 
      approximately 35% of the binding. Using the techniques of quantitative receptor 
      autoradiography, a distinct regional distribution of the subtypes of angiotensin 
      II antagonist bind was detected. The angiotensin II-1 binding site (the receptor 
      subtype preferentially displaced by DuP 753) appeared to predominate in the 
      dipsogenic, cardiovascular and endocrine areas, including the subfornical organ, 
      paraventricular and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, anterior 
      pituitary, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus of the solitary tract and 
      the area postrema. Additional areas that contained predominantly the angiotensin 
      II-1 receptor subtype were the ventral hippocampus, substantia gelatinosa of the 
      trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, piriform cortex and 
      median preoptic nucleus. The angiotensin II-2 binding site (displaced by WL 19) 
      was the predominant subtype in the thalamus, inferior olive, lateral septum, 
      subthalamic nucleus, locus coeruleus, medial geniculate and medial amygdala. 
      Several areas of the brain appeared to contain both receptor subtypes, including 
      the superior and inferior colliculi, and the olfactory bulb. The angiotensin II-1 
      binding site was concentrated in areas of the brain involved in mediating 
      angiotensin II effects on drinking, endocrine status and blood pressure. 
      Localization of angiotensin II-2 sites in the thalamus and areas of the brain 
      which process sensory information suggests a novel modulatory role for 
      angiotensin II at this receptor subtype. These results indicate that DuP 753 and 
      WL 19 are highly selective for angiotensin II binding site subtypes in the brain 
      and that, in general these subtypes are compartmentalized in distinct brain 
      regions. The non-peptide compounds used in these studies should provide excellent 
      tools to discern the functional role of angiotensin II receptor subtypes in the 
      brain.

TI  - Role of angiotensin II in the expression and regulation of transforming growth 
      factor-beta in obstructive nephropathy.
PG  - 1233-46
AB  - Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) leads to fibrosis of the obstructed kidney. 
      We tested the hypothesis that interstitial fibrosis in UUO results, at least in 
      part, from enhanced expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) 
      which in turn is regulated by local angiotensin II (Ang II) generation. (The 
      generic name TGF-beta is used to discuss properties shared by all isoforms, but 
      special reference to other isoforms is made when specifically needed.) Using 
      Northern blot and immunohistochemical analysis, we examined the expression of 
      TGF-beta in rat kidneys after 24 hours (aUUO) and one week (cUUO) of obstruction. 
      Obstructed kidneys from both periods had increased interstitial and perivascular 
      TGF-beta immunoreactivity compared to contralateral and sham kidneys, in which 
      immunostaining was confined to the inner medulla. Relative abundance of all 
      TGF-beta mRNA isoforms were higher in the obstructed than in contralateral and 
      sham kidneys in both aUUO and cUUO. Expression of TGF-beta isoforms varied 
      according to site (cortex vs. medulla), segment of the nephron, type of cells and 
      duration of the obstruction. The increase in TGF-beta immunoreactivity and mRNA 
      levels in aUUO and cUUO was almost totally abolished by pretreatment with 
      losartan. We conclude that in UUO: (a) TGF-beta gene expression is increased and 
      differentially regulated; (b) Ang II, at least partially, mediates the 
      overexpression of TGF-beta gene; and (c) Ang II may play a central role in 
      fibrogenesis in this and other models of tubulointerstitial disease.

TI  - Oral administration of DuP 753, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, to 
      normal male volunteers. Inhibition of pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I 
      and II.
PG  - 1333-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to assess the inhibitory effect 
      of DuP 753, an orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on the pressor 
      action of exogenous angiotensin I and II in healthy male volunteers. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: In the first study (single-dose study), eight volunteers were included 
      in a 2-day protocol repeated four times at 1-week intervals. In each phase, a 
      different dose of drug (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg) or placebo was given. The peak 
      systolic blood pressure response to a test-dose of angiotensin I was determined 
      serially before and after oral administration of DuP 753 by continuously 
      monitoring finger blood pressure using a photoplethysmographic method. DuP 753 
      reduced the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I in a dose-dependent 
      fashion. Three, 6, and 13 hours after the 40-mg dose, blood pressure response 
      decreased to 31 +/- 5%, 37 +/- 6%, and 45 +/- 3% of the control values (mean +/- 
      SEM, n = 7), respectively. In the second study, 29 volunteers were treated for 8 
      days with either a placebo or DuP 753 (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg p.o. q.d.) and 
      challenged on the first, fourth, and eighth days with bolus injections of 
      angiotensin II. Again, the inhibitory effect on the systolic blood pressure 
      response to angiotensin II was clearly dose dependent. Six hours after 40 mg DuP 
      753, the systolic blood pressure response to the test-dose of angiotensin II was 
      reduced to 37 +/- 7%, 40 +/- 4%, and 38 +/- 6% of baseline values (mean +/- SEM, 
      n = 6) on days 1, 4, and 8, respectively. With this latter dose, there was still 
      a blocking effect detectable 24 hours after the drug. Similar to angiotensin 
      converting enzyme and renin inhibitors, DuP 753 induced a dose-dependent increase 
      in plasma renin that was more pronounced on the eighth than on the first day of 
      drug administration. In these normal volunteers, no consistent clinically 
      significant side effects were observed. There was no evidence for an agonist 
      effect. CONCLUSIONS: DuP 753 appears to be a well-tolerated, orally active, 
      potent, and long-lasting antagonist of angiotensin II in men.

TI  - ANG II AT2 receptor modulates AT1 receptor-mediated descending vasa recta 
      endothelial Ca2+ signaling.
PG  - H779-89
AB  - We tested whether the respective angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) and 2 (AT(2)) 
      receptor subtype antagonists losartan and PD-123319 could block the descending 
      vasa recta (DVR) endothelial intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) 
      suppression induced by ANG II. ANG II partially reversed the increase in 
      [Ca(2+)](i) generated by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 10(-5) M), acetylcholine (ACh; 
      10(-5) M), or bradykinin (BK; 10(-7) M). Losartan (10(-5) M) blocked that effect. 
      When vessels were treated with ANG II before stimulation with BK and ACh, 
      concomitant AT(2) receptor blockade with PD-123319 (10(-8) M) augmented the 
      suppression of endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) responses. Similarly, preactivation with 
      the AT(2) receptor agonist CGP-42112A (10(-8) M) prevented AT(1) receptor 
      stimulation with ANG II + PD-123319 from suppressing endothelial [Ca(2+)](i). In 
      contrast to endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) suppression by ANG II, pericyte [Ca(2+)](i) 
      exhibited typical peak and plateau [Ca(2+)](i) responses that were blocked by 
      losartan but not PD-123319. DVR vasoconstriction by ANG II was augmented when 
      AT(2) receptors were blocked with PD-123319. Similarly, AT(2) receptor 
      stimulation with CGP-42112A delayed the onset of ANG II-induced constriction. 
      PD-123319 alone (10(-5) M) showed no AT(1)-like action to constrict microperfused 
      DVR or increase pericyte [Ca(2+)](i). We conclude that ANG II suppression of 
      endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) and stimulation of pericyte [Ca(2+)](i) is mediated by 
      AT(1) or AT(1)-like receptors. Furthermore, AT(2) receptor activation opposes ANG 
      II-induced endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) suppression and abrogates ANG II-induced DVR 
      vasoconstriction.

TI  - Zonal differentiation in the rat adrenal cortex.
PG  - 973-8
AB  - The factors that establish and maintain adrenocortical zonation are poorly 
      understood. The capsular adrenal gland of the rat has been shown to develop into 
      a functionally zoned tissue in autotransplanted glands in vivo. To examine this 
      in vitro, capsular gland preparations (largely glomerulosa (zg) with some 
      fasciculata (zf) were cultured in vitro in Eagles MEM (3.6mM K+) for 14 days. 
      Zonal differentiation was determined by immunocytochemical localisation of inner 
      zone antigen (IZA, zf/reticularis specific) and Pref-1 (zg specific). In the 
      absence of further additions these preparations invariably maintained a good 
      zonal arrangement of zg and zf over the whole period, though without significant 
      cellular proliferation. Neither the daily addition of the stimulants, maximally 
      8.3mM potassium, 1nM ACTH, or 100nM angiotensin II (AII), or the AII type 1 
      receptor antagonist losartan (10microM) had any significant effect on the glands 
      intrinsic capacity to maintain zonation in vitro. Aldosterone output declined 
      rapidly under control conditions (3.6mM K+), but was stimulated by AII, or high 
      K+ reaching a maximum after 7 days, and thereafter declined. However at higher K+ 
      conditions (5.6mM) aldosterone was not supported by angiotensin II. 
      Corticosterone secretion increased autonomously after 2 days in 3.6mM K+ then 
      declined. At higher K+ conditions corticosterone rapidly declined. The factors 
      studied had no effect on the inherent property of the adrenal gland to express 
      the zg or zf phenotype. However the functional steroidogenic capacity of the 
      adrenocortical cells was affected in a highly specific and complex manner by the 
      added stimulants.

TI  - Identification, distribution, and expression of angiotensin II receptors in the 
      normal human prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
PG  - 1349-56
AB  - The tissue distribution, cellular localization, and level of expression of 
      angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors were examined in the normal human prostate and 
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by in vitro autoradiography, 
      immunohistochemistry, and radioligand binding studies. In the normal human 
      prostate, Ang II receptors were of the AT(1) subtype and localized predominantly 
      to periurethral stromal smooth muscle. The AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan 
      totally displaced specific [(125)I]-[Sar(1),Ile(8)]Ang II binding, in a 
      concentration-dependent manner, whereas the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319 
      was without effect. There was no significant difference in receptor affinity, but 
      AT(1) receptor density was markedly reduced in BPH compared with that in normal 
      prostate. In rat prostate, Ang II (0.01-1 microM) produced a 
      concentration-dependent increase in [(3)H]-noradrenaline release from sympathetic 
      nerves. The findings of the present study suggest that angiotensin AT(1) 
      receptors predominate in the human prostate. The high concentration of AT(1) 
      receptors in the periurethral region suggests a role for Ang II in modulating 
      cell growth, smooth muscle tone, and possibly micturition. Furthermore, 
      down-regulation of AT(1) receptors in BPH may be due to receptor hyperstimulation 
      by increased local levels of Ang II in BPH. Finally, Ang II may play a functional 
      role in modulating sympathetic transmission in the prostate. These data support 
      the novel concept that activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved 
      in the pathophysiology of BPH.

      relationships for pulmonary delivered drugs. First, the inhaled drugs on the 
      market during 2001 were identified and a profile of the calculated 
      physicochemical properties was made. Second, an in vivo pharmacokinetic 
      investigation was performed in anesthetized rats. Eight selected drugs were 
      administered by intratracheal nebulization and intravenous bolus administration 
      and the plasma concentrations of the drugs were determined by LC-MS-MS. Third, an 
      evaluation of the relationships between the absorption/bioavailability data and 
      the drugs' physicochemical characteristics and the epithelial permeability in 
      Caco-2 cells, respectively, was performed. The drug absorption rate was found to 
      correlate to the molecular polar surface area and the hydrogen bonding potential, 
      as well as to the apparent permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers, which 
      indicated that passive diffusion was the predominating mechanism of absorption in 
      the rat lung. In contrast to the intestinal mucosa and the blood-brain barrier, 
      the pulmonary epithelium was shown to be highly permeable to compounds with high 
      molecular polar surface area (e.g., PSA 479 A(2)). Furthermore, a high 
      bioavailability was found for the efflux transporter substrates talinolol (81%) 
      and losartan (92%), which provides functional evidence for a quantitatively less 
      important role for efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein, in limiting the 
      absorption of these drugs from the rat lung. In conclusion, the pulmonary route 
      should be regarded as a potential alternative for the delivery of drugs that are 
      inadequately absorbed after oral administration.

TI  - Angiotensin-II receptor subtypes in fetal tissue of the rat: autoradiography, 
      guanine nucleotide sensitivity, and association with phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
PG  - 1075-82
AB  - Quantitative autoradiography revealed large numbers of angiotensin-II (AT) 
      receptors in the 18-day-old rat embryo. The selective AT-1 antagonist DuP 753 
      readily competed for AT receptors in liver, lung parenchyma, and choroid plexus, 
      and these receptors are classified as AT-1 receptors. The selective AT-2 
      displacers CGP 42112 A and/or PD 123177 competed with high affinity with AT bound 
      to most receptors located in skeletal muscle, skin, diaphragm, bronchi, and 
      stomach, and these receptors are classified as AT-2 receptors. The amount of AT-2 
      receptors in fetal tissue was more than 10-fold higher than that of AT-1 
      receptors. In skeletal muscle and skin, DuP 753 competed with AT in the presence 
      of 10(-7) M CGP 42112 A, indicating the presence of small numbers of AT-1 
      receptors. In liver and lung parenchyma, binding to AT-1 receptors was sensitive 
      to guanine nucleotides. AT binding to AT-2 receptors in fetal skin and skeletal 
      muscle was insensitive to guanine nucleotides. AT stimulated phosphoinositide 
      hydrolysis in liver (ED50, 64 nM) and in skin and skeletal muscle (ED50, 62 nM); 
      this was inhibited by DuP 753 (liver IC50, 38 nM; skin and skeletal muscle IC50, 
      26 nM), but not by PD 123177 in concentrations up to the micromolar range. AT-1 
      receptors are probably coupled to G-proteins, and their stimulation increases 
      phosphoinositide hydrolysis. AT-2 receptors may not be linked to G-proteins, 
      their stimulation is not associated with phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and the 
      nature of their second messenger system(s) is presently unknown.

      liver microsomes. Role of cytochrome P4503A(4) in formation of the active 
      metabolite EXP3174.
PG  - 285-9
AB  - The oxidative metabolism of losartan (DuP 753), a novel angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, by human liver microsomes and purified cytochrome P450 (P450) 
      enzymes, was studied. The primary route of metabolism of losartan is by oxidation 
      of the C5-hydroxymethyl to the carboxylic acid (EXP3174), which is an active 
      metabolite of losartan. When microsomes prepared from different human liver 
      samples were compared, EXP3174 formation activity was well correlated (r2 = 0.93) 
      with nifedipine oxidation (a marker of P4503A4), but not with markers for other 
      human liver P450s. Microsomal oxidation of losartan to EXP3174 was markedly 
      inhibited by gestodene and ketoconazole, selective inhibitors of P4503A enzymes, 
      but not by any of several other P450 inhibitors. Antibodies raised against 
      P4503A4 could inhibit most of the oxidation of losartan to EXP3174 in a 
      microsomal sample having high catalytic activity, but antibodies recognizing 
      other P450s had no effect. The oxidation of losartan to EXP3174 was catalyzed by 
      purified human liver microsomal P4503A4 and by purified bacterial recombinant 
      P4503A4. These results provide evidence that P4503A4 (and possibly other P4503A 
      enzymes) play a major role in the formation of an active metabolite EXP3174.

TI  - [Therapeutic interchange standardization for antiotensin II receptor antagonists 
      in the treatment of hypertension in the hospital setting].
PG  - 104-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Standardization of the therapeutic inter change process in the 
      hospital setting by the establishment and spreading of standard criteria has been 
      defined as an activity conducent to increased health care quality, and hence 
      improved patient care. OBJECTIVE: To establish standardized therapeutic swapping 
      for angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA-II) in the treatment of blood 
      hypertension, and to evaluate the suitability of therapeutic interchange in an 
      integrated individualized drug dispensation system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Standardized therapeutic inter-change was performed based on therapeutic 
      equivalence criteriafor ARA-Ils such as candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, 
      losartan,olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan, according to the pharmacodynamic 
      characteristics, dosage recommendations, pharmacokinetic characteristics and 
      interactions of each one of them. The suitability of therapeutic interchange was 
      assessed in terms of standardization or adaptation to this practice developed by 
      using percentage adherence in the previous 12 months (period A) and during the 12 
      months following its implementation and spread(period B). RESULTS: The only 
      ARA-II included in the hospital's pharmacotherapeutic guide is losartan, on which 
      standardized therapeutic interchange for initial and maintenance doses of any 
      drug within this class was based. The overall number of interchanges per-formed 
      was 417-216 during period A and 201 during period B. Implementing therapeutic 
      swapping has significantly increased adherence to explicitly established criteria 
      by 35.2% (95% CI:25.9 to 44.5%). Similarly, during period B a reduction in the 
      variability of therapeutic interchanges among various pharmacists was observed 
      regarding losartan dosage. DISCUSSION: The standardization of therapeutic 
      interchange procedures for ARA-lls allowed a reduction of the variability seen in 
      this process, and hence the potential for medication-related problems. Another 
      benefit of the spread of therapeutic swapping has been an increased adjustment of 
      medical prescriptions to the hospital's pharmacotherapeutic guide.

TI  - Angiotensin II type 2 receptor-mediated inhibition of NaCl absorption is blunted 
      in thick ascending limbs from Dahl salt-sensitive rats.
PG  - 765-9
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.199216 [doi]
AB  - NO reduces NaCl absorption by thick ascending limbs (TALs) by inhibiting the 
      Na/K/2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). We have shown that NO-induced inhibition of Na 
      transport is reduced in Dahl salt-sensitive rat (SS) TALs. Angiotensin II 
      increases NO production in TALs via angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R). It 
      is unknown whether AT(2)Rs regulate TAL NaCl absorption and whether this effect 
      is reduced in SS rats. We hypothesized that AT(2)R activation decreases TAL Na 
      transport via NO, and this effect is blunted in SS rats. In the presence of 
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, AT(2)R activation with 
      angiotensin II inhibited NKCC2 activity by 32±7% (P<0.03). AT(2)R antagonist 
      PD-123319 abolished the effect of angiotensin II. Activation with the 
      AT(2)R-selective agonist CGP42112A (10 nmol/L) decreased NKCC2 activity by 29±6% 
      (P<0.03). The effect of CGP42112A on NKCC2 activity was blocked by PD-123319 and 
      by NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. In Dahl 
      salt-resistant rat TALs, 1 nmol/L of CGP42112A decreased NKCC2 activity by 23±4% 
      (P<0.01). In SS TALs, it had no effect. TAL AT(2)R mRNA did not differ in SS 
      versus salt-resistant rats. We conclude the following: (1) TAL AT(2)R activation 
      decreases Na absorption; (2) this effect is mediated by AT(2)R-induced 
      stimulation of NO; (3) AT(2)R-induced reduction of NKCC2 activity is blunted in 
      SS rats; and (4) defects in AT(2)R/NO signaling rather than decreased AT(2)R 
      expression likely account for the blunted effect in SS TALs. Impaired 
      AT(2)R-mediated signaling in TALs could contribute to the Na retention associated 
      with salt-sensitive hypertension.

TI  - Glomerular permselectivity in early stages of overt diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 2129-37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairment of glomerular size selectivity has been demonstrated by 
      the dextran-sieving technique in nephropathic diabetics with heavy, but not mild 
      proteinuria. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether such a 
      barrier defect could be demonstrated with mild proteinuria by substituting Ficoll 
      70, a polysucrose, for dextran as a probe of the filtration barrier. METHODS: 
      Differential solute clearances were performed in 12 individuals with early 
      diabetic nephropathy on two occasions: after 60 days of treatment with losartan 
      50 mg daily or a placebo. An uncharged preparation of nonreabsorbable Ficoll 70 
      was infused along with inulin. Fractional clearance (theta) of Ficoll of discrete 
      size was determined after separating molecules in urine and plasma in narrow 2 A 
      fractions over a 20 to 60 A radius interval by size exclusion high-performance 
      liquid chromatography (HPLC). A hydrodynamic theory of hindered ficoll transport 
      through water-filled pores was used to characterize the pore size distribution of 
      the glomerular barrier. RESULTS: The theta for Ficoll molecules with radii> 50 A 
      was selectively enhanced in placebo-treated diabetic nephropathy versus 
      corresponding theta in healthy control subjects (N = 12). Computations revealed a 
      lower distribution of glomerular pores that was unaltered in nephropathic 
      diabetics. However, an upper distribution of large, shunt-like pores was more 
      prominent, exceeding healthy controls by one order of magnitude in diabetic 
      nephropathy (P = 0.01). A trend to lower theta for Ficoll in the 56 to 60 A 
      radius range during losartan therapy is computed to have lowered the fraction of 
      shunted filtrate by 26 to 44%, depending on whether glomerular pressure declined. 
      The corresponding reduction in theta for endogenous albumin, IgG, and IgG4 was by 
      19 to 23% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that shunt-like defects, 
      partially reversible by angiotensin II blockade, are present early in the course 
      of diabetic nephropathy. We estimate that such defects can account for 
      immunoglobulinuria in this disorder. Additional impairment of either charge- or 
      shape-selectivity must be invoked to explain the observed level of albuminuria, 
      however.

PG  - 61-74
AB  - The pulmonary absorption of nine low-molecular-weight (225-430 Da) drugs 
      (atenolol, budesonide, enalaprilat, enalapril, formoterol, losartan, metoprolol, 
      propranolol and terbutaline) and one high-molecular-weight membrane permeability 
      marker compound (FITC-dextran 10000 Da) was investigated using the isolated, 
      perfused and ventilated rat lung (IPL). The relationships between pulmonary 
      transport characteristics, epithelial permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers and 
      drug physicochemical properties were evaluated using multivariate data analysis. 
      Finally, an in vitro-in vivo correlation was made using in vivo rat lung 
      absorption data. The absorption half-life of the investigated drugs ranged from 2 
      to 59 min, and the extent of absorption from 21 to 94% in 2 h in the isolated 
      perfused rat lung model. The apparent first-order absorption rate constant in IPL 
      (ka(lung)) was found to correlate to the apparent permeability (P(app)) of Caco-2 
      cell monolayers (r = 0.87), cLog D(7.4) (r = 0.70), cLog P, and to the molecular 
      polar surface area (%PSA) (r = -0.79) of the drugs. A Partial Least Squares 
      (PLS)-model for prediction of the absorption rate (log ka(lung)) from the 
      descriptors log P(app), %PSA and cLogD(7.4) was found (Q2 = 0.74, R2 = 0.78). 
      Furthermore, a strong in vitro-in vivo correlation (r = 0.98) was found for the 
      in vitro (IPL) drug absorption half-life and the pulmonary absorption half-life 
      obtained in rats in vivo, based on a sub-set of five compounds.

TI  - [Effects of angiotensin II on the 3H-TdR incorporation and synthesis of collagen 
      in cultured bovine trabecular meshwork cells].
PG  - 209-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the cell 
      proliferation and collagen synthesis of bovine trabecular meshwork (TM) cells in 
      vitro. It may probe into the mechanism of primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG). 
      METHODS: (1) The bovine trabecular meshwork cells were cultured and identified by 
      immunohistochemistry method(neuronal specific enolas, NSE, factor related 
      antigan). The growing characteristics and morphological feature of cultured 
      primary and passaged cells were observed by invered microscope and 
      eletron-microscope; (2) Ang II(1 x 10(-7) mol.L-1 and 1 x 10(-8) mol.L-1) and 
      angiotensin receptor type I (AT1) antagonist (losartan) were incubated with 
      cultured TM cells. The cellular proliferation was measured by 
      3H-thymidine(3H-TdR) incorporation assay and collagen synthesis was indirectly 
      professed though detects the hydroxyproline of medium with chemistry methods. 
      RESULTS: The cells of bovine trabecular meshwork were cultured successfully. Most 
      of them were epithelia type. Ang II increased the TM cells uptake of 3H-TdR and 
      inhibited by losartan partially. Meanwhile the hydroxyproline of medium was 
      increased correspondingly. CONCLUSION: Establishing the method of culturing 
      bovine trabecular meshwork cells is an important method for researching the 
      characteristics of TM cells. Ang II can induce the cell proliferation of bovine 
      TM cells and increase the synthesis of collagen in vitro. The AT1 antagonist may 
      inhibit this cell proliferation effect.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin II receptor blockade on remnant glomerular 
      permselectivity.
PG  - 346-53
AB  - This study examined the mechanisms by which angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor 
      blockade improves glomerular barrier function in rats with reduced nephron 
      number. Proteinuria was measured at four weeks after 5/6 renal ablation, and rats 
      were then divided into a group which received the Ang II receptor blocker MK954 
      and a group which received no treatment. Studies performed one week later showed 
      that Ang II receptor blockade reduced proteinuria without altering GFR in renal 
      ablated rats. Micropuncture studies showed that Ang II blockade reduced both mean 
      arterial pressure (142 +/- 7 mm Hg, ablation without treatment; 105 +/- 2 mm Hg, 
      ablation with treatment) and glomerular transcapillary pressure (54 +/- 3 mm Hg, 
      ablation without treatment; 43 +/- 1 mm Hg, ablation with treatment). Dextran 
      sieving studies showed that untreated rats developed a size-selective defect 
      characterized by increased transglomerular passage of neutral dextrans with radii 
      54 to 76 A and a charge-selective defect characterized by an increased 
      transglomerular passage of anionic dextran sulfate with a radius of approximately 
      18 A. Ang II blockade reduced fractional clearance values for large neutral 
      dextrans near to values observed in normal rats but had no effect on the 
      fractional clearance of dextran sulfate (0.68 +/- 0.11, ablation without 
      treatment; 0.66 +/- 0.08, ablation with treatment; 0.46 +/- 0.05, normal rats). 
      These findings indicate that reducing Ang II activity improves size-selectivity 
      without affecting charge-selectivity in injured remnant glomeruli.

AB  - ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor 
      antagonists increase the effective renal plasma flow dose dependently, whereas 
      glomerular filtration rate does not change. Both substances reduce dose 
      dependently arterial blood pressure, glomerular capillary pressure and 
      proteinuria and are probably comparably renoprotective due to haemodynamic and 
      non-haemodynamic (e.g. antiproliferative) effects. These data indicate that the 
      renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists 
      are the results of inhibition of angiotensin II and not due to inhibition of 
      bradykinin degradation. Several studies suggest an additive renoprotective effect 
      of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, controlled 
      clinical studies are lacking. Experimental data suggest that the combination of 
      AT1 and AT2 receptor blockers or treatment with ACE inhibitors reduce more 
      effectively inflammatory cell infiltration into the kidney than angiotensin II 
      type 1 receptor antagonists alone. Long-term clinical trials using angiotensin II 
      type 1 receptor antagonists are needed before these substances can be recommended 
      as comparably renoprotective as ACE inhibitors.

      were isolated and identified as the 1'-hydroxy M2, 3'-hydroxy M1, and glucuronic 
      acid conjugated M3 derivatives. The structures of the metabolites were 
      established by UV, 1H-NMR spectroscopy and FAB-MS spectrometry and are identical 
      to metabolites produced by incubation of MK 954 with mammalian liver slices.

TI  - Binding of angiotensin antagonists to rat liver and brain membranes measured ex 
      vivo.
PG  - 760-4
AB  - 1. The effects of the angiotensin antagonists GR117289, losartan and 
      Sar1Ala8-angiotensin II on the ex vivo binding of [125I]-Sar1Ile8-angiotensin II 
      to rat liver and cortex/hippocampus (Cx/H) membranes have been investigated. 2. 
      GR117289 (0.1-30 mg kg-1, s.c., 2 h pretreatment) caused a dose-dependent 
      reduction in [125I]-Sar1Ile8-angiotensin II binding to both liver and 
      cortex/hippocampus membranes. 3. Administration of a submaximal dose of GR117289 
      (1 mg kg-1, s.c.) indicated that the peak inhibition of binding in the liver 
      occurred within 0.5 h, whereas the peak inhibition of binding in the Cx/H 
      occurred 2 h after drug treatment. 4. The effect of GR117289 was long lasting. 
      Binding was still reduced in the Cx/H 48 h after drug treatment (10 mg kg-1, 
      s.c.) but had returned to normal 72 h after drug treatment. In the liver binding 
      was still reduced 72 h after treatment with the same dose. 5. Losartan (1-30 mg 
      kg-1, s.c.) was equipotent with GR117289 in its ability to reduce liver binding, 
      but was less effective at inhibiting binding to central receptors. 6. The 
      non-peptide antagonist Sar1Ala8-angiotensin II (3 and 10 mg kg-1) reduced binding 
      in the liver but not in the Cx/H membranes. 7. These results suggest that, unlike 
      the peptide antagonist Sar1Ala8-angiotensin II, the non-peptide angiotensin 
      antagonists, GR117289 and losartan, are able to cross the blood brain barrier and 
      occupy central angiotensin II receptors.

TI  - [3H]DUP 753, a highly potent and specific radioligand for the angiotensin II-1 
      receptor subtype.
PG  - 1195-202
AB  - [3H]Dup 753, a nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist radioligand, 
      was used to characterize a subtype of AII receptors in rat adrenal cortical 
      microsomes. By Scatchard analysis, a single class of DuP 753 binding sites was 
      found with an affinity of 6.4 nM and a Bmax of 1.3 pmol/mg protein. These sites 
      were saturable and readily reversible. Angiotensin (I, II, III) expressed the 
      same affinities and order of potency for these binding sites as those labeled by 
      [3H]AII for the AII-1 sites. The affinities expressed by nonpeptide AII 
      antagonists were commensurate with their inhibitory potencies on AII-1 receptors. 
      PD123177, an AII-2 specific ligand, and other non-AII peptides showed no 
      inhibitory action. These data together with the differential tissue distribution 
      strongly support our conclusion that [3H]DuP 753 is a potent and highly specific 
      radioligand for the AII-1 receptors.

TI  - Effect of chronic treatment with losartan on streptozotocin induced diabetic 
      rats.
PG  - 31-4
AB  - Treatment of rats with streptozotocin (STZ, 45mg/kg, i.v.,single dose) produced 
      cardinal symptoms of diabetes mellitus including hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia 
      and increase in blood pressure. Treatment with losartan--an angiotensin (AT1) 
      receptor antagonist, 2 mg/kg, po for 6 weeks decreased the blood glucose levels 
      by 16.5%. There was 190% increase in AUCglucose and 59.4% decrease in AUCinsulin 
      in STZ-diabetic rats as compared to control rats. Treatment with losartan caused 
      slight decrease in AUCglucose and slight increase in AUCinsulin. There was no 
      significant difference in insulin sensitivity (K(ITT)) index of STZ-diabetic 
      group as compared to control. Losartan treatment failed to alter these levels 
      significantly. Serum cholesterol and creatinine levels were found to be increased 
      significantly in STZ-diabetic rats. Treatment with losartan significantly 
      prevented the rise in cholesterol and creatinine levels by 20.1 and 81% 
      respectively. The results suggest that losartan produces some beneficial effects 
      in STZ-diabetic rats.

TI  - Effects of losartan in combination with or without exercise on insulin resistance 
      in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats.
PG  - 359-67
AB  - Hypertension often complicates type 2 diabetes mellitus, and angiotensin 
      converting enzyme inhibitor treatment has been shown to improve insulin 
      resistance in such cases. However, the effect of angiotensin II type-1 (AT(1)) 
      receptor antagonists on insulin resistance is still controversial. To gain 
      further information on this effect, we examined the effect of losartan on insulin 
      resistance in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. Losartan administration alone lowered systolic blood pressure, 
      but did not improve oral glucose tolerance test or insulin resistance in OLETF 
      rats. However, the administration of losartan with exercise significantly 
      improved both systolic blood pressure and insulin resistance relative to control 
      OLETF rats. On the other hand, losartan treatment, regardless of exercise, 
      increased glucose uptake in excised soleus muscle and fat cells. To explore the 
      beneficial effect of losartan on skeletal muscle glucose uptake, we examined 
      intracellular signaling of soleus muscle. Although Akt activity and glucose 
      transporter type 4 (GLUT4) expressions were not affected by losartan with or 
      without exercise, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 
      mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities were increased by both 
      interventions. These results indicate that angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist 
      improved local insulin resistance, but not systemic insulin resistance. These 
      findings may explain the controversy over the effect of angiotensin AT(1) 
      receptor antagonists on insulin resistance in clinical use. The enhancing effect 
      of angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist on skeletal muscle glucose uptake may be 
      attributable to MAP kinase activation or other mechanisms rather than 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.

TI  - Effect of angiotensin II on calcium reabsorption by the luminal membranes of the 
      nephron.
PG  - E928-36
AB  - In the rat and the rabbit, a number of studies have reported the effects of 
      angiotensin II (ANG II) on Na(+) reabsorption by the proximal (PT) and distal 
      (DT) convoluted tubules of the kidney. The aim of the present study was to 
      examine the effect of ANG II on Ca(2+) uptake by the luminal membranes of the PT 
      and DT of the rabbit. Incubation of PT and DT with 10(-12) M ANG II enhanced the 
      initial Ca(2+) uptake in the two segments. Dose-response experiments revealed, 
      for Ca(2+) as well as for Na(+) transport, a biphasic action with a maximal 
      effect at 10(-12) M. Ca(2+) transport by the DT luminal membrane presents a dual 
      kinetic. ANG II action influenced the high-affinity Ca(2+) channel, increasing 
      maximal velocity from 0.72 +/- 0.03 to 0.90 +/- 0.05 pmol x microg(-1) x 10 s(-1) 
      (P < 0.05, n = 3) and leaving the Michaelis-Menten constant unchanged. The effect 
      of ANG II was abolished by losartan, suggesting that the hormone is acting 
      through AT1 receptors. In the PT, calphostin C inhibited the effect of the 
      hormone. It is therefore probable that protein kinase C is involved as a 
      messenger. In the DT, however, neither Rp cAMP, calphostin C, nor econazole (a 
      phospholipase A inhibitor) influenced the hormone action. Therefore, the 
      mechanisms involved in the hormone action remain undetermined. Finally, we 
      questioned whether ANG II acts in the same DT segment as does parathyroid hormone 
      on Ca(2+) transport. The two hormones increased Ca(2+) transport, but their 
      actions were not additive, suggesting that they both influence the same channels 
      in the same segment of the distal nephron, i.e., the segment responsible for the 
      high-affinity calcium channel.

TI  - AngRem104, an angiotensin II-induced novel upregulated gene in human mesangial 
      cells, is potentially involved in the regulation of fibronectin expression.
PG  - 1443-51
AB  - Accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the glomerular mesangium is a 
      common feature of many progressive renal diseases. Angiotensin II (AngII) plays 
      important roles in the proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (MC) as well 
      as the synthesis of ECM such as fibronectin (FN) and collagens. However, the 
      precise molecular signals responsible for these effects are unknown. To explore 
      possible molecule mechanism of ECM accumulation related to AngII, suppression 
      subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed to screen and identify upregulated 
      genes induced by AngII in cultured human MC. A novel gene, AngRem104 (GenBank 
      accession number, AF367870), was isolated. The full-length cDNA of AngRem104 is 
      1690 bp, and it contains a 1041-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 347 amino 
      acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 37.2 kD. AngRem104 widely 
      expressed in human heart, placenta, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas. 
      Moreover, AngRem104 was found in human glomeruli and tubule by in situ 
      hybridization. In human MC, the upregulation of AngRem104 induced by AngII was 
      time-dependent, and it was dose-dependently blocked by AngII type 1 receptor 
      antagonist (AT1RA), Losartan. The subcellular localization detected by 
      AngRem104-pEGFP fusion protein revealed that AngRem104 was a nuclear protein. 
      Interestingly, when AngRem104 was overexpressed by transfection of its sense 
      construct, cDNA Microarray showed that two of the ECM-related genes, i.e., human 
      mRNA for FN and integrin-beta-1 (FN receptor), dramatically upregulated their 
      expressions. Furthermore, AngRem104 could regulate the expression of FN induced 
      by AngII, which were detected by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR, when 
      AngRem104 was overexpressed. It is concluded that AngRem104 is a novel human gene 
      potentially involved in the regulation of FN induced by AngII in human MC. These 
      findings may provide new insights into mechanisms of glomerular sclerosis 
      associated with AngII.

TI  - Role of the renin-angiotensin system in the compensation of quinpirole-induced 
      blood pressure decrease.
PG  - 427-33
AB  - The dopamine D(2)-like receptor agonist quinpirole has been reported to lower 
      blood pressure. This effect appears to be mediated via activation of presynaptic 
      D(2)-like receptors inhibiting the stimulated neural norepinephrine release. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the role of renal nerves and the 
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the blood pressure lowering effect of 
      quinpirole. Therefore, clearance experiments using different doses of quinpirole 
      (0.3 to 100 microg/kg/min) were performed in thiopental-anesthetized rats with 
      intact kidneys (INN) or 5 to 7 days after bilateral renal denervation (DNX). The 
      functional involvement of the RAS in the blood pressure lowering effect of 
      quinpirole was determined in rats pretreated with a subpressor dose of 
      angiotensin II (10 microg/kg/min) or in rats pretreated with the angiotensin II 
      (AT(1)) receptor antagonist losartan, in a subdepressor dose (10 microg/kg/min). 
      Quinpirole dose-dependently decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by up to 
      29%. This blood pressure lowering effect of quinpirole was observed at lower 
      doses in DNX rats when compared with INN animals (ED(50): 0.98 microg/kg/min in 
      DNX vs. 6.02 microg/kg/min in INN animals). Quinpirole in a dose of 3 
      microg/kg/min, which did not affect MAP in vehicle treated INN rats, 
      significantly reduced MAP in rats with losartan pretreatment. In DNX rats 
      pretreated with angiotensin II the MAP-response to the infusion of 3 
      microg/kg/min quinpirole was clearly attenuated in comparison with untreated DNX 
      animals. Our data show that stimulation of dopamine D(2)-like receptors 
      dose-dependently decreased blood pressure, which was potentiated by both 
      interruption of the renal innervation and AT(1) receptor blockade, while 
      exogenous ANG II restored the enhancement of the blood pressure response to 
      quinpirole. We conclude that the increased vasodilatory effect of quinpirole 
      after renal denervation might depend on a decreased activity of the RAS.

TI  - Role of AT1 and AT2 receptors in the plasma clearance of angiotensin II.
PG  - 464-9
AB  - This study assessed the role of angiotensin (Ang) AT1 and AT2 receptors as 
      modulators of the plasma clearance of Ang II. Groups of male spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats (SHRs; n = 25) were given an intravenous injection of either 
      saline, losartan, PD123319, losartan in combination with PD123319, or 
      Sar1-Thr8-Ang II. One hour later, Ang II (0.5 microg/kg) was infused for 15 min 
      into a vein. Immediately thereafter, arterial blood samples were collected at 
      regular intervals for the assay of plasma Ang II levels by radioimmunoassay. The 
      infusion of Ang II significantly increased baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
      in rats pretreated with either saline or PD123319 but not in those receiving 
      losartan, losartan combined with PD123319, or Sar1-Thr8-Ang II. The plasma 
      clearance of Ang II was significantly greater in rats injected with either 
      PD123319, losartan combined with PD123319, or Sar1-Thr8-Ang II compared to those 
      injected either saline or losartan. Furthermore, the half-life of Ang II in rats 
      pretreated with saline or losartan was significantly greater than that measured 
      in the other three groups. These results suggest that plasma clearance of Ang II 
      in the SHRs is independent of an AT1 receptor, but plasma levels of the peptide 
      are unexpectedly protected by an AT2 receptor-dependent mechanism.

PG  - 35-7
AB  - The influence of afobazole on isoenzyme CYP2C9 production in rats was studied 
      using losartan as the marker drug. Single dose of losartan was administered 
      orally without afobazole in a dose of 30 mg/kg and in the same single (30 mg/kg) 
      on the background of 3- and 4-day administration of afobazole in a dose of 5, 25, 
      75, 100, and 125 mg/kg. At 5 mg/kg (effective dose for anxiolytic effect), 
      afobazole did not cause any induction/inhibition effect on CYP2C9 isoenzyme. A 
      multiple increase in afobazole dose was manifested by a moderate induction 
      effect. The maximum induction effect of afobazole was achieved in a dose of 75 
      mg/kg. At doses above 75 mg/kg, the induction effect of afobazole was less 
      pronounced.

TI  - High- or low-salt diet from weaning to adulthood: effect on insulin sensitivity 
      in Wistar rats.
PG  - 424-9
AB  - Because of conflicting results in the literature, further studies are needed to 
      confirm an association between the degree of salt consumption and insulin 
      sensitivity. The aim of this study was to measure insulin sensitivity in rats fed 
      from weaning to adulthood with a low (LSD), normal (NSD), or high (HSD) salt 
      diet. Body weight, carcass lipid content, blood glucose, nonesterified fatty 
      acids, plasma insulin, plasma renin activity, and a glucose transporter (GLUT4) 
      were measured. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was used in 52 anesthetized 
      rats. Body weight was higher in rats on LSD than in those on NSD (P<0.05) or HSD 
      (P<0.001). Percentage fat carcass content was higher (P<0.05) in rats on LSD than 
      in those on NSD. Basal plasma insulin and glucose levels were not altered 
      (P>0.05) by salt consumption. Nonesterified fatty acids were lower in rats on HSD 
      than in those on LSD (P<0.05) or NSD (P<0.01). Glucose uptake was lower in rats 
      on LSD than in those on NSD (P<0.05) or HSD (P<0. 001). When a euglycemic 
      hyperinsulinemic clamp was used on pair-weight rats, similar results were 
      obtained, which suggests that the effect of LSD on insulin sensitivity was not 
      due to higher body weight. GLUT4 in insulin-sensitive tissues was increased in 
      rats on HSD except in the cardiac muscle. Captopril treatment partially reversed 
      low insulin sensitivity in LSD rats, whereas losartan did not change it, which 
      indicates that the effect of LSD on insulin sensitivity is angiotensin 
      independent. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that chronic dietary 
      salt restriction induces a decrease in insulin sensitivity not associated with 
      renin-angiotensin system activity or body weight changes.

TI  - Localization of AT(2) receptors in the nucleus of the solitary tract of 
      spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar Kyoto rats using [125I] CGP42112: 
      upregulation of a non-angiotensin II binding site following unilateral nodose 
      ganglionectomy.
PG  - 139-55
AB  - We have examined the binding distribution of a selective AT(2) receptor ligand 
      [125I] CGP42112 in the brain of adult Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats (SHR). AT(2) receptor localization was also examined in the rat 
      brainstem following unilateral nodose ganglionectomy. Specific [125I] CGP42112 
      binding was observed in discrete brain regions from both rat strains, including 
      the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and did not differ between WKY and SHR. 
      [125I] CGP42112 binding in the NTS revealed an AT(2) receptor component that was 
      displaceable by PD 123319 and Ang II (50-58%), as well as a non-angiotensin II 
      receptor component (42-49%). Following unilateral nodose ganglionectomy, [125I] 
      CGP42112 binding density on the denervated side of the NTS was increased 
      approximately two-fold in both WKY and SHR. This increased [125I] CGP42112 
      binding density in the ipsilateral NTS was comprised of a greater non-angiotensin 
      II component than that observed in the sham groups, since only approximately 30% 
      was displaced by PD123319 and angiotensin II. Furthermore, [125I] CGP42112 also 
      revealed high binding density on the denervated side in the dorsal motor nucleus 
      and the nucleus ambiguus in both WKY and SHR. AT(2) receptor immunoreactivity was 
      also visualised in the NTS of sham operated rats, but was not observed in the 
      dorsal motor nucleus or the nucleus ambiguus, nor was it up-regulated following 
      nodose ganglionectomy. These results demonstrate, for the first time, an AT(2) 
      receptor binding site in the NTS, as well as a non-angiotensin II [125I] CGP42112 
      binding site. These studies also demonstrate that nodose ganglionectomy 
      represents a useful model in which to study a non-angiotensin II [125I] CGP42112 
      binding site that is up-regulated following degeneration of afferent vagal 
      nerves.

TI  - Evaluation of the ability of irbesartan to cross the blood-brain barrier 
      following acute intragastric treatment.
PG  - 15-21
AB  - The present study evaluated in functional tests the ability of the angiotensin 
      AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan, 
      2-n-butyl-3-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1,3-d 
      iaza-spiro[4,4]non-1-en-4-one, in comparison to losartan, 
      2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) 
      bi-phenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole, to cross the blood-brain barrier following acute 
      intragastric administration. Two tests were used: the dipsogenic response to 
      intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II, and Na+ intake in response 
      to adrenalectomy. In normotensive rats, irbesartan reduced the dipsogenic 
      response to angiotensin II, 10 pmol per rat, at the dose of 90 mg/kg, but not at 
      lower doses. Losartan significantly reduced angiotensin II-induced drinking at 30 
      mg/kg, but not at a lower dose. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, irbesartan 
      reduced the response to angiotensin II at 50 mg/kg, but not at lower doses, while 
      losartan significantly inhibited angiotensin II-induced drinking even at 10 
      mg/kg. In adrenalectomized rats, the intake of 2% NaCl was inhibited by the 
      intragastric administration of losartan 30 or 50 mg/kg, while irbesartan did not 
      reduce it in doses up to 50 mg/kg. The results of the present study consistently 
      indicate that after acute intragastric administration, the ability of irbesartan 
      to cross the blood-brain barrier is lower than that of losartan.

TI  - Oxidative stress in the infarcted heart: role of de novo angiotensin II 
      production.
PG  - 943-51
AB  - This study aimed to elucidate whether angiotensin (Ang) II generated de novo at 
      the infarct site regulates the redox state of inflammatory cells participating in 
      cardiac repair. On days 3-28 following ligation of the rat left coronary artery, 
      we addressed at the infarct site: (a) the appearance and cellular origin of 
      oxidative stress by monitoring the expression (mRNA and protein) of gp91phox (a 
      subunit of superoxide producing NADPH oxidase) and the antioxidant superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD), together with the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine (a marker of 
      oxidative stress); (b) the presence of components requisite to Ang peptide 
      generation; and (c) response to treatment with losartan (Los, 10mg/kg/day). We 
      found at the infarct site, macrophage-derived oxidative stress appears during 
      week 1 coincident with the appearance of components requisite to AngII generation 
      and activity in these cells. Based on observed response to AT1 receptor 
      antagonism with Los, we would suggest de novo AngII, in an autocrine manner, 
      participates in the induction of oxidative stress while suppressing the 
      expression of antioxidant defenses.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin II receptor blockade on proximal fluid uptake in the rat 
      kidney.
PG  - 697-700
AB  - Angiotensin II has a well described dose-dependent biphasic action on proximal 
      tubule fluid uptake, although the concentration and effect of endogenous luminal 
      angiotensin II remain controversial. Shrinking split-droplet micropuncture was 
      used to examine the fluid uptake in response to the luminal application of three 
      AT1 antagonists (losartan, EXP3174, candesartan). Addition of losartan at 10(-8) 
      M decreased fluid uptake rate (Jva) by 17.5+/-2.2% (P<0.05). Luminal addition of 
      EXP3174 at concentrations between 10(-9)-10(-5) M caused a dose-dependent 
      decrease in fluid uptake, with a maximum decrease of 41.0+/-9.5% (P<0.01) at 
      10(-6) M. Candesartan also decreased fluid uptake, by 21.9+/-4.9% (P<0.05) at 
      10(-8) M and 23.6+/-5.5% (P<0.05) at 10(-5) M. All three antagonists at a low 
      concentration (10(-8) M) decreased fluid uptake. EXP3174 and candesartan at a 
      higher concentration (10(-5) M) also decreased fluid uptake in contrast to the 
      previously reported effect of losartan. We conclude that the endogenous 
      concentration of antiotensin II in the proximal luminal fluid is low and exerts a 
      stimulatory effect on fluid absorption. Losartan at concentrations greater than 
      10(-6) M may have a non-selective action on fluid uptake.

TI  - Neuroendocrine effects of dehydration in mice lacking the angiotensin AT1a 
      receptor.
PG  - 482-6
AB  - Angiotensin (Ang) type 1a (AT1a) receptors are critical in the control of blood 
      pressure and water balance. Experiments were performed to determine the influence 
      of dehydration on brain Ang receptors and plasma vasopressin (VP) in mice lacking 
      this receptor. Control or AT1a knockout (AT1aKO) male mice were give water ad 
      libitum or deprived of water for 48 hours. Animals were anesthetized with 
      halothane, blood samples were collected by heart puncture, and brains were 
      processed for Ang-receptor autoradiography with 125I-sarthran (0.4 nmol/L). 
      Dehydration produced an increase in AT1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus 
      (PVN) and anterior pituitary (AP) in control mice (PVN: 70+/-16 versus 146+/-10 
      fmol/mg protein; AP: 41+/-7 versus 86+/-15 fmol/mg protein). No changes were 
      noted in the median preoptic nucleus. The majority of the brain receptors were of 
      the AT1 subtype. There was little or no specific Ang binding in AT1aKO mice and 
      no effect of dehydration. Plasma VP levels were elevated in the 
      halothane-anesthetized animals (>200 pg/mL) with no significant effect of 
      dehydration. A separate experiment was performed with decapitated mice 
      anesthetized with pentobarbital. Dehydration increased plasma VP in control mice, 
      from 3.3+/-0.6 to 13.3+/-4.7 pg/mL, whereas no change was noted in the AT1aKO 
      mice, 5.1+/-0.3 versus 6.1+/-0.7 pg/mL (water versus dehydration). These results 
      demonstrate a differential response to dehydration in mice lacking AT1a 
      receptors. There was no evidence for AT1 receptors of any subtype in the brain 
      regions examined and no effect of dehydration on VP secretion or brain Ang 
      receptors.

AB  - Mean 24-hour blood pressure values of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) 
      are more closely related with target organ damage and cardiovascular events in 
      hypertension, than clinic measurements. Both daytime and nighttime blood pressure 
      and short-term blood pressure variability associated with these intermediate and 
      hard cardiovascular outcomes abd should be controlled with antihypertensive 
      treatment. A large increase in blood pressure variability may also occur in the 
      early morning and with some antihypertensive drugs, without a consistent and 
      smooth, more than 24-hour effect. For example, unlike some other angiotensin 
      receptor blockers, telmisartan provides consistent blood pressure reduction for 
      24-hour, including the critical early morning period.

TI  - Alpha 1-adrenergic control of chloride transport in the rat S1 proximal tubule.
PG  - F1049-56
AB  - To identify in vivo the specific alpha-adrenergic receptor mediating direct 
      neural control of chloride transport in the rat S1 proximal convoluted tubule 
      (PCT), the major effector site of neural regulation, microperfusion was employed 
      in conjunction with the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, 
      prazosin and rauwolscine. Using a glomerular ultrafiltrate-like perfusate, 
      prazosin markedly inhibited chloride transport by -42% (302 +/- 10 to 176 +/- 5 
      peq.mm-1.min-1, P < 0.0001). Using a sodium chloride perfusate, which measures 
      the active component of chloride absorption (J(Cl)act) (control, 153 
      peq.mm-1.min-1) plus a constant passive (479 peq.mm-1.min-1) component, both 
      prazosin and acute renal denervation reduced J(Cl)act by -38% and -44% (-58 and 
      -67 peq.mm-1.min-1, each P < 0.05). In contrast, rauwolscine caused no 
      significant change in J(Cl)act using either perfusate. Prazosin regulates 
      chloride transport via protein kinase C (PKC), since preactivation of PKC by 
      phorbol abolished inhibitory impact of prazosin. Inhibition of J(Cl)act by 
      prazosin (-58 peq.mm-1.min-1) was fully additive to either the stimulation or 
      inhibition (losartan) of angiotensin II (55 or -49 peq.mm-1.min-1), which uses 
      the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system [observed 
      changes, not significantly different from 0 and -99 peq.mm-1.min-1; expected 
      changes, not significantly different from 0 and -107 peq.mm-1.min-1]. In 
      conclusion, neural control of S1 PCT chloride absorption in vivo is mediated by 
      alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, which can selectively regulate J(Cl)act by altering 
      PKC activity, independently of the cAMP second messenger system.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptors in the human adrenal gland.
PG  - 355-61
AB  - In the present study, we have characterized distribution and pharmacological 
      properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in human adrenals frozen 
      immediately after removal. Autoradiographic studies indicate that Ang II 
      receptors are present throughout the gland. Co-incubations with DUP 753, a 
      specific antagonist of the AT1 receptor, and with PD 123319, a specific 
      antagonist of the AT2 receptor, reveal that Ang II receptors are mainly of type 
      2. The AT1 receptors are detected after 16 weeks of gestation at the periphery of 
      the gland. Competition studies and Scatchard analysis reveal a homogenous 
      population of high affinity AT2 binding sites (Kd = 0.68 +/- 0.1 nM). Binding 
      capacities decrease from 1080 +/- 304 fmol/mg protein at 14 weeks to 275 +/- 55 
      fmol/mg protein at 21 weeks. These results differ from those obtained in adult 
      glands where autoradiographic studies reveal that the AT1 receptors are found 
      mainly in the zona glomerulosa and AT2 receptors mainly in the medulla. These 
      data suggest that the AT2 receptors could be involved in the morphological or 
      functional differentiation of the human fetal adrenal gland.

TI  - Ouabain at nanomolar concentration promotes synthesis and release of angiotensin 
      II from the endothelium of the tail vascular bed of spontaneously hypertensive 
      rats.
PG  - 372-80
AB  - The effects of 1 nM ouabain (OUA) on the contractile actions of phenylephrine 
      (PHE, 0.001-100 microg) and functional activity of the sodium pump (NKA) in 
      isolated-perfused tail vascular beds from WKY and SHR were investigated. In 
      preparations from SHR, perfusion with OUA in the presence of endothelium (E+) 
      increased the sensitivity (pED50) of PHE (before: 2.14 +/- 0.06 versus after: 
      2.47 +/- 0.07; P < 0.05) without altering the maximal response (Emax). After 
      endothelial damage, OUA reduced the Emax of PHE in SHR (before: 350 +/- 29 versus 
      after: 293 +/- 25 mm Hg; P < 0.05). In SHR/E+, pretreatment with losartan (10 
      microM) or enalaprilat (1 microM) prevented the increased sensitivity to PHE 
      induced by OUA. OUA increased NKA activity in SHR/E+ (before: 45 +/- 6 versus 
      after: 58 +/- 5%, P < 0.05). Losartan (10 mg/Kg, i.v.) also abolished the 
      increment in systolic and diastolic blood pressure induced by OUA (0.18 
      microg/Kg, i.v.) in anesthetized SHR. OUA did not alter the actions of PHE in 
      either anesthetized WKY rats or vascular preparations. Results suggest that 1 nM 
      OUA increased the vascular reactivity to PHE only in SHR/E+. This effect is 
      mediated by OUA-induced activation of endothelial angiotensin converting enzyme 
      that promotes the local formation of angiotensin II, which sensitizes the 
      vascular smooth muscle to the actions of PHE.

LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.1998.275.1.F74 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we examined whether the effect of endogenously produced 
      angiotensin II on proximal tubule transport in the male Sprague-Dawley rat is 
      regulated by acute changes in extracellular volume. We measured the magnitude of 
      endogenous angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of transport by sequentially 
      perfusing proximal tubules in vivo, first with an ultrafiltrate-like solution, 
      then by reperfusion of the same tubule with an ultrafiltrate-like solution 
      containing 10(-8) M losartan (angiotensin II receptor antagonist). During volume 
      contraction, 10(-8) M losartan decreased volume reabsorption from 4.20 +/- 0.50 
      to 1.70 +/- 0.30 nl . mm-1 . min-1 (P < 0.05), a decrease of 58.0 +/- 7.0%. In 
      contrast, after acute volume expansion, 10(-8) M losartan decreased volume 
      reabsorption from 1.84 +/- 0.20 to 1.31 +/- 0.20 nl . mm-1 . min-1 (P < 0.05), a 
      decrease of 29.6 +/- 9.0%. In hydropenic rats, addition of exogenous luminal 
      angiotensin II had no effect on transport. However, in volume-expanded rats, 
      addition of 10(-8) M angiotensin II increased volume reabsorption from 2.10 +/- 
      0.34 to 4. 38 +/- 0.59 nl . mm-1 . min-1 (P < 0.005). These data are consistent 
      with endogenously produced angiotensin II augmenting proximal tubule transport to 
      a greater degree during volume contraction than after volume expansion.

TI  - [Irbesartan: a new possibility in the treatment of hypertension].
PG  - 1187-92
AB  - Hypertension means a basic public health problem in many countries in the world. 
      The therapeutic attempts of the last years did not fulfill the hopes pinned on 
      them, and most of the patients live with blood pressure above the goal value. 
      This is why there is a need for new, more efficient antihypertensive drugs. On 
      the 1st of July, 2001 irbesartan (Aprovel) was introduced in practice in Hungary. 
      The drug belongs to the family of the angiotensin II receptor inhibitors. Several 
      clinical studies were made with irbesartan in order to evaluate its efficiency, 
      tolerability and safety. In other studies it was compared with other 
      antihypertensive treatments and it was found that irbesartan decreases the 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure as effectively as other first line 
      medicaments. The author summarizes the most important characteristics of 
      irbesartan as well as the results of those clinical studies which show evidence 
      that irbesartan deserves a special place among antihypertensive drugs.

TI  - Platelet aggregability in patients with hypertension treated with angiotensin II 
      type 1 receptor blockers.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - AIM: Cardiovascular events associated with hypertension often involve thrombosis. 
      Increased platelet activity is one of the risk factors of cardiovascular 
      diseases. Antithrombotic properties of antihypertensive agents are not fully 
      characterized. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used for 
      the treatment of hypertension. Some ARBs can provoke antiaggregatory effects on 
      platelets in vitro. Whether ARBs can inhibit platelet aggregation was tested in 
      hypertensive patients in vivo. METHODS: Platelet aggregation was assessed by the 
      highly sensitive particle counting method using laser-light scattering. RESULTS: 
      Large platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 3 microM) was 
      2.6+/-0.4 (x10(7)) (SE) in hypertensive patients treated with losartan (72+/-3 
      years old, n=10) while it was 3.9+/-0.6 in hypertensive patients treated with 
      candesartan (70+/-5 years old, n=6; p=0.056). Large platelet aggregation induced 
      by thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, U46619 (10 microM), was 2.8+/-0.5 (x10(7)) in 
      hypertensive patients treated with losartan while it was 5.1+/-0.9 in 
      hypertensive patients treated with candesartan (p=0.033). Clinical 
      characteristics including the control of blood pressure did not differ between 
      the two groups (losartan 136+/-5/73+/-3 mmHg vs. candesartan 135+/-4/76+/-5). 
      CONCLUSION: Thus, losartan may have the possibility to inhibit platelet 
      activation in patients with hypertension independent of blood pressure reduction. 
      Antiaggregatory properties may be independent of angiotensin II type 1 receptor 
      or of antihypertensive actions. The favorable effects of losartan on reduction of 
      adverse cardiovascular events among hypertensive patients may be at least partly 
      mediated by inhibition of platelet activation.

TI  - The metabolism of DuP 753, a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, by 
      rat, monkey, and human liver slices.
PG  - 281-7
AB  - The in vitro metabolism of DuP 753, a novel nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, has been investigated in incubations with liver slice preparations 
      from rats, monkeys and humans. Metabolites were identified by HPLC/MS, FAB/MS, 
      Cl/MS, and/or 1H NMR. In the rat, the primary route of metabolism was oxidative, 
      leading to either monohydroxylated or oxidized (carboxylic acid) metabolites, 
      whereas in monkeys, glucuronidation of the tetrazole moiety predominated. An 
      equal mixture of both oxidized and glucuronic acid-conjugated metabolites was 
      isolated from incubations with human liver slices. All metabolites were tested in 
      an in vitro assay to determine their activity as angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists. The monohydroxylated products and glucuronic acid conjugates were 
      determined to be much less active than DuP 753. Biotransformation to the 
      carboxylic acid, however, was shown to dramatically increase the activity of this 
      agent. The in vivo duration of action of DuP 753 has been observed to be much 
      longer in the rat than in the monkey. This may be explained, at least in part, by 
      these in vitro metabolism studies. The predominance of glucuronidation observed 
      in incubations with monkey liver slices would yield metabolites with diminished 
      activity and might be expected to shorten the in vivo duration of DuP 753 in that 
      species. The oxidative conversion to the carboxylic acid metabolite, along with 
      the low level of glucuronidation observed in incubations with rat liver slices, 
      may be responsible for the prolonged duration observed in vivo in the rat.

TI  - [Therapeutic interchange between angiotensin II receptor blockers in 
      institutionalized elderly patients. Implimenting a protocol].
PG  - 290-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic interchange protocol for 
      angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB's) in the maintenance of blood pressure 
      levels for institutionalized elderly patients diagnosed with hypertension. 
      METHODS: A new protocol was discussed by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, 
      and its implementation by the Pharmacy Department was authorized. The protocol 
      specifies equivalent doses between drugs and the patients' clinical follow-up. 
      Criteria used in the assessment includes: need to change dosage for an ARB 
      included in the Pharmacotherapeutic Guide, and blood pressure changes after drug 
      interchange. RESULTS: In the absence of hepatic insufficiency, the protocol may 
      replace the standard doses of any drugs within this group with losartan 50 mg 
      daily. If needed, the dose of losartan may be increased to 100 mg daily divided 
      into two doses. Eighteen patients, which represent 10% of all interchange 
      operations carried out by the Pharmacy Department, were included in this study. 
      Blood pressures both before and after the interchange process show no major 
      differences between them. Only two patients required an increase in the dose of 
      losartan. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a therapeutic interchange protocol as 
      agreed upon by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee allows the clinical 
      follow-up of patients and therefore facilitates an evaluation of the process. 
      This ARB interchange protocol, as suggested for the institutionalized elderly 
      population setting, has proven effective in maintaining anti-hypertensive 
      activity.

TI  - Angiotensin II reduces macrophage cholesterol efflux: a role for the AT-1 
      receptor but not for the ABC1 transporter.
PG  - 1529-34
AB  - Impaired cellular cholesterol efflux in cells of the arterial wall is suggested 
      to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Since angiotensin II 
      (Ang-II) is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, the aim of the 
      present study was to determine whether Ang-II could affect macrophage cholesterol 
      efflux. Incubation of increasing concentrations of Ang-II (10(-10)-10(-7) M) with 
      mouse peritoneal macrophages that were prelabeled with [3H]cholesterol led to a 
      significant decrease in HDL-induced macrophage cholesterol efflux, by up to 70% 
      compared to control cells incubated without Ang-II. Ang-II specifically increased 
      the plasma membrane unesterified cholesterol content, the substrate for 
      HDL-induced cholesterol efflux. The inhibitory effect of Ang-II on macrophage 
      cholesterol efflux was found to be mediated by the angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) 
      receptor, since addition of the AT-1 antagonist Losartan completely blocked the 
      inhibitory effect of Ang-II on the macrophage cholesterol efflux. We thus 
      conclude that Ang-II atherogenicity may be related, at least in part, to its 
      inhibitory effect on macrophage cholesterol efflux, thus leading to cellular 
      cholesterol accumulation, the hallmark of early atherogenesis.

TI  - Effect of angiotensin II receptor blockade on proximal tubular fluid 
      reabsorption.
PG  - R510-7
AB  - The effect of physiological concentrations of angiotensin II on proximal tubular 
      fluid reabsorption remains controversial. To investigate the effect of blockade 
      of intratubular AT1 receptors on tubular reabsorption, losartan (10(-5) M) was 
      administered by microperfusion into an early proximal convolution of 
      halothane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Four parameters that depend on the 
      rate of proximal fluid reabsorption were measured: proximal intratubular pressure 
      (Pprox), early and late proximal flow rate, and early distal NaCl concentration. 
      Pprox decreased by 0.5 +/- 0.1 mmHg, late proximal flow rate decreased by 2.0 +/- 
      0.8 nl/min, and early distal NaCl concentration decreased by 4.3 +/- 0.8 mM (mean 
      +/- SE). No changes were observed after microperfusion with saline. Because the 
      tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism was operating in the closed-loop mode, the 
      decreased NaCl load to the macula densa will be compensated by an increase in the 
      single-nephron glomerular filtration rate. In agreement with this, the early 
      proximal flow rate, measured proximal to the site of losartan administration, 
      increased by 5.7 +/- 1.3 nl/min. The increase in the rate of proximal 
      reabsorption between the early and late proximal convolutions was estimated to be 
      7.8 nl/min (approximately 36%). It is concluded that a decrease in local luminal 
      angiotensin II levels and/or AT1 receptor activity under free flow conditions 
      increases the rate of proximal tubular fluid reabsorption.

TI  - Surviving rat distal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption: effects of chronic AT(1) 
      blockade.
PG  - F476-83
AB  - To determine the in vivo effects of chronic ANG II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor 
      blockade by losartan (Los) on enhanced unidirectional bicarbonate reabsorption 
      (J(HCO(3))) of surviving distal tubules, nephrectomized rats drank either water 
      or a solution of Los, 7 days before microperfusion. J(HCO(3)) was suppressed by 
      50% after Los without further reduction by 5 nM concanamycin A (Conc), suggesting 
      that Los suppresses all Conc-sensitive H(+)-ATPase pumping. Indeed, 
      ultrastructural analysis of A-type intercalated cells revealed a 50% reduction of 
      H(+)-ATPase immunogold labeling of the apical plasma membrane, whereas Western 
      blotting showed that H(+)-ATPase protein levels were also reduced by one-half by 
      Los treatment. To identify other transporters sustaining J(HCO(3)), we perfused 
      three inhibitors simultaneously [5-(N, N-dimethyl) amiloride hydrochloride, Conc, 
      Schering 28080] with or without prior Los treatment: J(HCO(3)) was unchanged 
      despite marked reduction of water reabsorption. We conclude enhanced distal 
      tubule J(HCO(3)) of surviving nephrons is largely mediated by AT(1) 
      receptor-dependent synthesis and insertion of apical H(+)-ATPase pumps in A-type 
      intercalated cells.

TI  - Assessment of angiotensin II receptor blockade in humans using a standardized 
      angiotensin II receptor-binding assay.
PG  - 1201-8
AB  - An in vitro angiotensin II (AngII) receptor-binding assay was developed to 
      monitor the degree of receptor blockade in standardized conditions. This in vitro 
      method was validated by comparing its results with those obtained in vivo with 
      the injection of exogenous AngII and the measurement of the AngII-induced changes 
      in systolic blood pressure. For this purpose, 12 normotensive subjects were 
      enrolled in a double-blind, four-way cross-over study comparing the AngII 
      receptor blockade induced by a single oral dose of losartan (50 mg), valsartan 
      (80 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), and placebo. A significant linear relationship 
      between the two methods was found (r = 0.723, n = 191, P<.001). However, there 
      exists a wide scatter of the in vivo data in the absence of active AngII receptor 
      blockade. Thus, the relationship between the two methods is markedly improved (r 
      = 0.87, n = 47, P<.001) when only measurements done 4 h after administration of 
      the drugs are considered (maximal antagonist activity observed in vivo) 
      suggesting that the two methods are equally effective in assessing the degree of 
      AT-1 receptor blockade, but with a greatly reduced variability in the in vitro 
      assay. In addition, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis performed with 
      the three antagonists suggest that the AT-1 receptor-binding assay works as a 
      bioassay that integrates the antagonistic property of all active drug components 
      of the plasma. This standardized in vitro-binding assay represents a simple, 
      reproducible, and precise tool to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of 
      AngII receptor antagonists in humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determining negative results associated with medication through an 
      active search of possible drug interactions in databases for patients affiliated 
      to the Colombian general social security/health system. METHODS: Statistics 
      related to Audifarma S.A. dispensation drug databases for about 4 million 
      Colombian users were systematically reviewed for identifying drugs having known 
      interactions involving risk, doses different from recommended ones or irregular 
      dispensation. The pertinent health-care providing services were made aware of the 
      above. RESULTS: There was one case of nephrotoxicity being caused by zoledronic 
      acid. 37 % of clopidogrel users concomitantly received omeprazole which reduces 
      the former's effectiveness. 29.9 % of patients who were taking losartan were 
      receiving doses higher than the recommended ones. 2.0 % of patients who were 
      taking metoprolol or verapamil were simultaneously receiving them, at the risk of 
      generating first-degree heart block, bradycardia, or systolic dysfunction. All 
      these cases were notified to the pertinent health-care services. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Active pharmacosurveillance leads to resources being optimised, adverse events 
      which can potentially cause morbidity or lethality being prevented or even 
      determining problems which could be responsible for therapeutic failure. This 
      type of strategy anticipates the appearance of possible risks for patients, 
      meaning that drug use monitoring programmes in Colombia should be reinforced.

TI  - [EVALUATION OF THE PHARMACOKINETIC INTERACTION OF AFOBAZOLE WITH CYP2C9 ENZYME 
      DRUG SUBSTRATE OF CYTOCHROME P450].
PG  - 18-22
AB  - We have studied the pharmacokinetics of drug-marker of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 
      CYP2C9 (losartan) and its metabolite E-3174 after subchronic oral administration 
      of afobazole in doses 5 and 25 mg/kg in rats. The metabolic ratio (MR) of 
      E-3174/Losartan was calculated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan and 
      its metabolite on the background of 4-day afabazole administration 5 mg/kg dose 
      were not significantly different from analogous values calculated for the control 
      group of rats. Therefore, afobazole in the effective anxiolytic dose did not 
      change the MR value of metabolized P450 isoform. A five-fold dose increase in the 
      afobazole dose led to significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      including A UC0-t, Cmax, Kel, t1/2el, MRT, CL/F, and Vd/F of losartan and AUC0-T, 
      Cmax, and Tmax of E-3174. These findings are indicative of the induction of 
      CYP2C9 isoenzyme by afobazole.

TI  - Endogenous angiotensin II does not contribute to sympathetic venoconstriction in 
      dorsal hand veins of healthy humans.
PG  - 327-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sympathetically mediated venoconstriction is augmented by exogenously 
      administered angiotensin II. This study was designed to assess whether endogenous 
      angiotensin II influences sympathetically mediated venous tone. METHODS: 
      Responses of dorsal hand veins to local intravenous administration of subsystemic 
      doses of losartan, an angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist, were assessed 
      with use of a well-validated displacement technique in eight healthy male 
      volunteers. In a four-phase study, responses to local infusions of angiotensin II 
      (4 to 64 ng/min) and norepinephrine (1 to 128 ng/min) or to sympathetic 
      venoconstriction produced by a single deep breath were compared in the presence 
      of either saline placebo or 30 microg/min losartan. Each phase of the study was 
      conducted on a separate day, in random order, and each phase was separated by at 
      least 1 week. RESULTS: Angiotensin II (p = 0.03) and norepinephrine (p < 0.001) 
      caused dose-dependent venoconstriction. Losartan attenuated the venoconstriction 
      induced by angiotensin II (p = 0.048) but had no effect on the responses to 
      norepinephrine or the venoconstriction induced by a single deep breath. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to exogenously administered angiotensin II, basal 
      endogenous angiotensin II does not influence sympathetically mediated 
      venoconstriction in healthy humans. However, endogenous angiotensin II may have a 
      role in circumstances of renin-angiotensin system activation, such as salt 
      depletion.

TI  - Characterization and distribution of angiotensin II binding sites in fetal and 
      neonatal astrocytes from different rat brain regions.
PG  - 372-6
AB  - Although angiotensin II (Ang II) binding sites have been extensively investigated 
      in brain, revealing the presence of both AT1 and AT2 subtypes in various areas, 
      the question as to which cells express AT1 and AT2 sites is still open. We report 
      here that primary cultures of astrocytes obtained from various brain regions of 
      fetal (F17) and one-day-old rats express Ang II binding sites belonging only to 
      the AT1 subtype. The binding sites have the same binding profile in all regions 
      tested; however, much less binding was observed in membranes of astrocytes 
      derived from cortical than from subcortical regions and almost none were found in 
      neonatal cortex. In addition, the dispersion method used at the onset of culture 
      affects the number of binding sites present at the end of the culture period.

TI  - The angiotensin AT2 receptor is present in the human fetal adrenal gland 
      throughout the second trimester of gestation.
PG  - 3914-22
AB  - The aim of the present study was to characterize distribution and pharmacological 
      properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in human fetal adrenals frozen 
      immediately after removal. Autoradiographic studies indicate that Ang II 
      receptors are present throughout the gland. Coincubations with DUP 753, a 
      specific antagonist of the AT1 receptor, and with PD 123319, a specific 
      antagonist of the AT2 receptor, reveal that Ang II receptors are mainly of the 
      type 2. The AT1 receptors are detected after 16 weeks of gestation at the 
      periphery of the gland. Binding of 125I-Ang II to membrane preparations is 
      dose-dependent and saturable. Competition studies and Scatchard analysis reveal a 
      homogenous population of high-affinity AT2 binding sites (Kd = 0.68 +/- 0.1 
      nmol/L). Binding capacities decrease from 1080 +/- 304 fmol/mg protein at 14 
      weeks to 275 +/- 55 fmol/mg protein at 21 weeks. However, when fetal adrenal 
      cells are prepared and cultured for 6 days, the proportion of AT1 receptors 
      increases, indicating that culture conditions induce expression of the AT1 
      receptor. These results differ from those obtained in adult glands, where 
      autoradiographic studies reveal that the AT1 receptors are found mainly in zona 
      glomerulosa and AT2 receptors mainly in the medulla. These data suggest that the 
      AT2 receptors could be involved in the morphological or functional 
      differentiation of the human fetal adrenal gland.

TI  - [Angiotensin II receptors in the heart conduction tissue].
PG  - 511-6
AB  - Angiotensin II exerts a positive chronotropic effect on mammalian heart. This 
      effect can be mediated either by activation of the sympathetic nervous system or 
      binding to specific receptors located in cardiac conduction tissue. Recently, two 
      angiotensin II receptor subtypes have been identified in rat tissues. In the 
      present study, we have investigated tissue distribution of angiotensin II 
      receptor subtypes in conduction tissue obtained from rat hearts, employing an in 
      situ autoradiographic technique. Receptor subtypes were identified by use of the 
      peptide antagonists losartan (AT1) and PD123,177 (AT2). Angiotensin II binding 
      was homogeneously distributed in right and left ventricle, and interventricular 
      septum, with each subtype accounting for approximately 50% of the specific 
      binding. Receptor density in the conduction tissue, identified by 
      acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, was quantitated by counting the silver 
      grains on tissue sections which, following incubation, were dipped in 
      photographic emulsion and developed. In both sinoatrial and atrioventricular node 
      AT1 and AT2 receptors were homogeneously distributed. Receptor density in 
      sinoatrial node was comparable to myocardium, whereas it was significantly higher 
      (p < 0.02) in atrioventricular node. In conclusion, both AT1 and AT2 receptors 
      are homogeneously distributed in cardiac conduction tissue. Binding density is 
      higher in the atrioventricular node than in the other structures examined in our 
      study, suggesting a possible role of angiotensin II in the atrioventricular 
      conduction.

TI  - Responses to an orally active renin inhibitor, remikiren (Ro 42-5892), after 
      controlled salt depletion in humans.
PG  - 347-53
AB  - The biological effects of dose-dependent inhibition of renin have rarely been 
      extensively studied after oral (p.o.) dosing in humans. We studied remikiren 
      (Ro42-4892), a selective renin inhibitor, in normal volunteers after activation 
      of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) based on salt depletion. Twelve normal men 
      (28 +/- 9 years, 77 +/- 10 kg), comprising three consecutive dose panels of 4 
      subjects, received four treatments, double-blind and randomised 2 weeks apart: 
      panel I, placebo (P), or 30, 100, and 300 mg, remikiren; panel II, placebo or 
      300, 600 mg, 1,000; panel III, placebo or 30, 600, and 1,000 mg. The RAS was 
      activated by 40 mmol/day sodium diet plus frusemide (40 mg BDS), for 3 days 
      before each study day. Data (mean +/- SD) were examined by repeated-measures 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). RAS activation was confirmed by 24-h urinary sodium 
      excretion (screen, 142 +/- 74 mmol/24 h; prestudy, 66 +/- 33, 59 +/- 41, 78 +/- 
      4, 73 +/- 30 mmol/24 h) and increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) (screen, 0.8 
      +/- 0.3 ng AI/ml/h; before dosing, P, 6.5 +/- 3.1; 30 mg, 8.2 +/- 3; 100 mg, 9.4

PG  - 581-4
AB  - The localization of subtypes of the angiotensin II receptor has been determined 
      by autoradiographic techniques using iodinated angiotensin II and two nonpeptide 
      antagonists that exhibit selective affinities. DuP 753 specifically displaces 
      type 1 sites (AII-1) and PD123177 inhibits only type 2 sites (AII-2). The rabbit 
      adrenal cortex contains predominately AII-1 sites and the few AII-2 sites that 
      are present are nonuniformly distributed. In the rabbit kidney, the fibrous outer 
      sheath contains exclusively AII-2 sites whereas the glomeruli of the renal cortex 
      and the renal medulla exhibit only AII-1 sites.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin receptor subtype inhibitors on plasma angiotensin 
      clearance.
PG  - 853-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether angiotensin receptor subtypes play 
      a role in angiotensin clearance from plasma. Angiotensin metabolic clearance rate 
      was measured in rats by the constant infusion method. Increasing doses of 
      angiotensin II were infused for 15 minutes, and blood was sampled for angiotensin 
      II. The type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan decreased the apparent 
      metabolic clearance rate by > 50% at low-dose infusion, suggesting that type 1 
      angiotensin II receptors are involved in angiotensin II clearance from plasma. At 
      higher angiotensin infusion rates, the-metabolic clearance rate of angiotensin 
      was unaffected. To dissect the contribution of renin-generated angiotensin, 
      additional experiments were performed in nephrectomized rats. In anephric rats, 
      angiotensin clearance was unaffected by type 1 angiotensin II receptor 
      inhibition. In contrast, the type 2 angiotensin II receptor ligand PD123319 in 
      intact rats caused a > 50% increase in metabolic clearance rate of angiotensin at 
      higher infusion rates (P < .05). In anephric rats, the type 2 angiotensin II 
      receptor ligand alone or combined with type 1 receptor inhibition was without 
      effect on the metabolic clearance rate or the T1/2 for angiotensin disappearance. 
      These data argue against a role for type 1 or 2 angiotensin II receptors as 
      clearance receptors. Increased clearance of angiotensin by type 2 receptor 
      blockade in the presence but not the absence of kidneys suggests an alternative 
      renal mechanism by which selective type 2 ligands may alter angiotensin effects.

TI  - Angiotensin-(1-7) increases osmotic water permeability in isolated toad skin.
PG  - 1099-104
AB  - Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) increased osmotic water permeability in the 
      isolated toad skin, a tissue with functional properties similar to those of the 
      distal mammalian nephron. Concentrations of 0.1 to 10 microM were effective, with 
      a peak at 20 min. This effect was similar in magnitude to that of frog skin 
      angiotensin II (Ang II) and oxytocin but lower than that of human Ang II and 
      arginine-vasotocin. The AT2 angiotensin receptor antagonist PD 123319 (1.0 
      microM) fully inhibited the response to 0.1 microM Ang-(1-7) but had no effect on 
      the response to Ang II at the same concentration. The specific receptor 
      antagonist of Ang-(1-7), A-779, was ineffective in blocking the response to 
      Ang-(1-7) and to frog skin Ang II. The AT1 receptor subtype antagonist losartan, 
      which blocked the response to frog skin Ang II, was ineffective in blocking the 
      response to Ang-(1-7). The present results support the view of an antidiuretic 
      action of Ang-(1-7) in the mammalian nephron.

TI  - Human aortic smooth muscle cells containing angiotensin II type 1 receptors.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - We characterized the angiotensin II (AII) receptor in human aortic smooth muscle 
      cells (HASMCs). This receptor binds [125I]Sar1,Ile8-angiotensin II with a high 
      affinity of 0.20 +/- 0.04 nM and a low capacity of 5.3 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein 
      (230 +/- 17 sites/cell). Based on the Ki values, the ranking order of 
      [125I]Sar1,Ile8-AII binding inhibition was as follows: Sar1,Ile8-AII > AII > Dup 
      753 > AII > AI >> PD 123319. The addition of AII to HASMCs induced a rapid, 
      transient increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration followed by a lower, 
      sustained phase. When extracellular Ca2+ was removed by adding 3 mM EGTA, this 
      initial transient increase was not changed, but the sustained phase was 
      abolished. These results revealed AII receptors in HASMCs to be of the type 1 
      receptor subtype, which induce Ca2+ mobilization mainly from intracellular Ca2+ 
      stores.

TI  - Distribution of Fos in rat brain resulting from endogenously-generated 
      angiotensin II.
PG  - 1567-9
AB  - The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol has been used in these studies to 
      elevate circulating levels of angiotensin II. Neurons in the brain responsive to 
      the subcutaneous infusion of isoproterenol were identified using an antibody to 
      Fos, the protein product of c-fos which is now used extensively as a marker of 
      activated neurons. Fos-positive neurons were present in a range of specific 
      forebrain and hind brain regions. Infusion of losartan (an angiotensin II type 
      receptor antagonist) showed that neurons in the lamina terminalis were activated 
      directly or indirectly by angiotensin II, whereas other neurons in the 
      hypothalamus and brain stem were responsive as a consequence of the peripheral 
      vasodilation caused by isoproterenol. The distribution of activated neurons in 
      the lamina terminalis was consistent with that of neurons thought to be involved 
      in water drinking.

TI  - Comparative effects of losartan, captopril, and enalapril on murine acute 
      myocarditis due to encephalomyocarditis virus.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - Losartan, a recently developed nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor 
      antagonist, was orally administered for 14 days to mice with viral myocarditis, 
      beginning 7 days after encephalomyocarditis virus inoculation. The 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) captopril and enalapril were also 
      administered in the same manner to compare the therapeutic effects of these three 
      drugs on the degree of myocarditis, acute heart failure, and left ventricular 
      (LV) hypertrophy. Heart weight and the heart weight/body weight ratio were 
      reduced by losartan (60 mg/kg/day) and captopril (7.5 mg/kg/day), but not by 
      enalapril (1 mg/kg/day). LV wall thickness and cavity dimension were decreased in 
      the losartan and captopril groups. Captopril reduced both myocardial necrosis and 
      inflammation, whereas enalapril reduced myocardial necrosis but not inflammation. 
      However, none of the studied losartan doses (1.2, 12, 60 mg/kg/day) influenced 
      myocardial necrosis and inflammation resulting from viral infection. Thus, 
      specific blockade of AII is beneficial in congestive heart failure (CHF) and LV 
      hypertrophy but is not effective in viral-evoked inflammation and injury.

AB  - Dry blood spot (DBS) analysis has been extensively used for the quantitative 
      analysis of drugs by mass spectrometry; however, utilization of DBS for 
      qualitative metabolite profiling has been very limited. In the present study, we 
      investigated the use of DBS for metabolite profiling of genistein, carbamazepine, 
      losartan, sunitinib, sildenafil and zoniporide representing a range of Phase I 
      and Phase II biotransformations following oral and intravenous dosing to rats. 
      Plasma and DBS were collected for PK and metabolite profiling. Analyte extraction 
      recovery from DBS was optimized using the parent compound and metabolite 
      standard. Rat DBS metabolite profiles from all six compounds were similar to 
      plasma metabolite profiles, however Phase II metabolites appeared to be extracted 
      less efficiently from DBS compared to plasma, and compounds that were unstable in 
      blood showed different metabolite profiles. In summary, this study showed that in 
      addition to PK bioanalytical analysis, DBS samples may also be utilized for 
      metabolite profiling and a comparison of plasma and DBS metabolite profiling can 
      also provide partitioning/association of major circulating metabolites compared 
      to the parent drug even in the absence of a metabolite standard.

TI  - Valsartan in chronic heart failure.
PG  - 460-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for valsartan in the treatment of heart 
      failure and determine its need for formulary inclusion. DATA SOURCES: OVID and 
      PubMed databases were searched (1983-June 2004) using the key words 
      angiotensin-receptor blocker, heart failure, valsartan, Diovan, and 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Only English-language literature was 
      selected. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic 
      evaluations for valsartan were selected. Prospective, randomized clinical trials 
      investigating the use of valsartan and other angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) 
      in chronic heart failure were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Valsartan, a selective 
      antagonist for angiotensin receptor subtype 1, is the first ARB to be approved 
      for use in chronic heart failure. Clinical trial data support valsartan as an 
      alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in ACE 
      inhibitor-intolerant patients with chronic heart failure. Valsartan is generally 
      well tolerated, with renal impairment, elevated serum creatinine and potassium 
      levels, and dizziness being the most common adverse effects; consequently, 
      patients experiencing those adverse events while taking ACE inhibitors are likely 
      to experience them with valsartan. Although further study is needed, differences 
      in effectiveness among races may exist with use of valsartan; however, at this 
      time, valsartan is recommended as an alternative to ACE inhibitors regardless of 
      race. Candesartan and losartan have been studied in similar settings. 
      Candesartan's data support its use in heart failure; however, losartan's data 
      have been less consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Valsartan is a safe and effective 
      alternative for heart failure patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Valsartan 
      has not been shown to be safe and effective when used in combination with ACE 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Local angiotensin II generation in the rat heart: role of renin uptake.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - To elucidate the local effects of renin in the coronary circulation, we examined 
      local angiotensin (Ang) I and II formation, as well as coronary vasoconstriction 
      in response to renin administration, and compared the effects with exogenous 
      infused Ang I. We perfused isolated hearts from rats overexpressing the human 
      angiotensinogen gene in a Langendorff preparation and measured the hemodynamic 
      effects and the released products. We also investigated cardiac Ang I conversion, 
      including the contribution of non-angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent Ang 
      II-generating pathways. Finally, we studied Ang I conversion in vitro in heart 
      homogenates. Renin and Ang I infusion both generated Ang II. Ang II release and 
      vasoconstriction continued after renin infusion was stopped, even though renin 
      disappeared immediately from the perfusate. In contrast, after Ang I infusion, 
      Ang II release and coronary flow returned to basal levels. Ang I conversion (Ang 
      II/Ang I ratio) was higher after renin infusion (0.109+/-0.027 versus 
      0.026+/-0.003, 15 minutes, P<.02) compared with infused Ang I. Remikiren added to 
      the renin infusion abolished Ang I and II; captopril suppressed only Ang II, 
      whereas an AT1 receptor blocker did not affect Ang I and II formation. All the 
      drugs prevented renin-induced coronary flow changes. Total cardiac Ang II-forming 
      activity was only partially inhibited by cilazaprilat (4.1+/-0.1 fmol x min(-1) x 
      mg[-1]) and on a larger extent by chymostatin (2.6+/-0.3 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1]) 
      compared with control values (5.6+/-0.4 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1]). We conclude 
      that renin can be taken up by cardiac or coronary vascular tissue and induces 
      long-lasting local Ang II generation and vasoconstriction. Locally formed Ang I 
      was converted more effectively than infused Ang I. Furthermore, the comparison of 
      in vivo and in vitro Ang I conversion suggests that in vitro assays may 
      underestimate the functional contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme to 
      intracardiac Ang II formation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alterations in the expression of the Angiotensin II type 1 
      receptors (AT(1)R) have been demonstrated in the development of several heart and 
      renal diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the novel compound 
      [(18)F]fluoropyridine-candesartan as a PET imaging tracer of AT(1)R in rat 
      kidneys. METHODS: Competition binding assays were carried out with membranes from 
      CHO-K1 cells expressing human AT(1)R. Binding to plasma proteins was assessed by 
      ultrafiltration. Radiolabeled metabolites in rat plasma and kidneys of control 
      and pretreated animals (candesartan 10 mg/kg or losartan 30 mg/kg) were analyzed 
      by column-switch HPLC. Dynamic PET/CT images of [(18)F]fluoropyridine-candesartan 
      in male Sprague-Dawley rats were acquired for 60 min at baseline, pre-treatment 
      with the AT(1)R antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg) or the AT(2)R antagonist PD123,319 
      (5 mg/kg). RESULTS: Fluoropyridine-candesartan bound with a high affinity for 
      AT(1)R (Ki = 5.9 ± 1.1 nM), comparable to fluoropyridine-losartan but lower than 
      the parent compound candesartan (Ki = 0.4 ± 0.1 nM). 
      [(18)F]Fluoropyridine-candesartan bound strongly to plasma proteins (99.3%) and 
      was mainly metabolized to radiolabeled hydrophilic compounds, displaying minimal 
      interference on renal AT(1)R binding with 82% of unchanged tracer in the kidneys 
      at 20 min post-injection. PET imaging displayed high renal and liver 
      accumulations and slow clearances, with maximum tissue-to-blood ratios of 14 ± 3 
      and 54 ± 12 in kidney cortex and liver, respectively, at 10 min post-injection. 
      Binding specificity for AT(1)R was demonstrated with marked reductions in kidney 
      cortex (-84%) and liver (-93%) tissue-to-blood ratios at 20 min post-injection, 
      when blocking with AT(1)R antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg). No change was observed 
      in kidney cortex of rats pre-treated with AT(2)R antagonist PD 123,319 (5 mg/kg), 
      confirming binding selectivity for AT(1) over AT(2) receptors. CONCLUSION: High 
      kidney-to-blood ratios and binding selectivity to renal AT(1)R combined with 
      tracer in vivo stability displaying minimal interference from labeled metabolites 
      support further PET imaging studies with [(18)F]fluoropyridine-candesartan.

TI  - Angiotensin II inhibits NaCl absorption in the rat medullary thick ascending 
      limb.
PG  - F404-10
AB  - NaCl reabsorption in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle (MTALH) 
      contributes to NaCl balance and is also responsible for the creation of medullary 
      interstitial hypertonicity. Despite the presence of angiotensin II subtype 1 
      (AT(1)) receptors in both the luminal and the basolateral plasma membranes of 
      MTALH cells, no information is available on the effect of angiotensin II on NaCl 
      reabsorption in MTALH and, furthermore, on angiotensin II-dependent medullary 
      interstitial osmolality. MTALHs from male Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and 
      microperfused in vitro; transepithelial net chloride absorption (J(Cl)) as well 
      as transepithelial voltage (V(te)) were measured. Luminal or peritubular 10(-11) 
      and 10(-10) M angiotensin II had no effect on J(Cl) or V(te). However, 10(-8) M 
      luminal or peritubular angiotensin II reversibly decreased both J(Cl) and V(te). 
      The effect of both luminal and peritubular angiotensin II was prevented by the 
      presence of losartan (10(-6) M). By contrast, PD-23319, an AT(2)-receptor 
      antagonist, did not alter the inhibitory effect of 10(-8) M angiotensin II. 
      Finally, no additive effect of luminal and peritubular angiotensin II was 
      observed. We conclude that both luminal and peritubular angiotensin II inhibit 
      NaCl absorption in the MTALH via AT(1) receptors. Because of intrarenal 
      angiotensin II synthesis, angiotensin II concentration in medullary tubular and 
      interstitial fluids may be similar in vivo to the concentration that displays an 
      inhibitory effect on NaCl reabsorption under the present experimental conditions.

AB  - The objective was to compare several in vitro human liver-derived subcellular and 
      cellular incubation systems for the formation of GSH-trapped reactive 
      metabolites. Incubations of pooled human liver microsomes, human liver S9 
      fractions, HepaRG-cells, and human hepatocytes were performed with glutathione as 
      a trapping agent. Experiments with liver S9 were performed under two conditions, 
      using only NADPH and using a full set of cofactors enabling also conjugative 
      metabolism. Ten structurally different compounds were used as a test set, chosen 
      as either "positive" (ciprofloxacin, clozapine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, 
      pulegone, and ticlopidine) or "negative" (caffeine, citalopram, losartan, 
      montelukast) compounds, based on their known adverse reactions on liver or bone 
      marrow. GSH conjugates were observed for seven of the ten compounds; while no 
      conjugates were observed for caffeine, citalopram, or ciprofloxacin. Hepatocyte 
      and HepaRG assays produced a clearly lower number and lower relative abundance of 
      GSH conjugates compared to assays with microsomes and S9 fractions. The major GSH 
      conjugates were different for many compounds in cellular subfractions and 
      cell-based systems. Hepatocytes generally produced a higher number of GSH 
      conjugates than HepaRG cells, although the differences were minor. The results 
      show that the hepatic enzyme system used for screening of GSH-trapped reactive 
      metabolites do have a high impact on the results, and results between different 
      systems are comparable only qualitatively.

PG  - 11-7
AB  - Three characteristics of antihypertensive medication are pivotal in therapy for a 
      patient with hypertension: potency and efficacy, duration of action, and the 
      incidence of side-effects. The relatively new class of AT1-receptor blockers all 
      display placebo-like tolerability and, as a class, their antihypertensive 
      efficacy compares well with other antihypertensive classes. However, it is 
      unclear whether clinically important differences in duration of action and 
      antihypertensive efficacy exist within the AT1-receptor blocker class itself. The 
      results of a number of head-to-head clinical comparisons between these agents 
      suggest that candesartan cilexetil and irbesartan may be more effective than the 
      prototype AT1-receptor blocker, losartan. In addition, studies using ambulatory 
      blood pressure recording techniques have clarified the relative durations of 
      antihypertensive action of the AT1-receptor blockers. In particular, studies 
      mimicking the common event of a missed or delayed dose of antihypertensive 
      medication, show that the antihypertensive effect of candesartan cilexetil 
      extends well beyond the 24-h dosing interval, while the effect of losartan 
      declines rapidly over this period. The available evidence therefore suggests that 
      significant differences in efficacy and duration of action are apparent within 
      the AT1-receptor blocker class, and that these differences may well translate 
      into clinically relevant differences in cardiovascular outcome.

AB  - Hypertensive patients require adequate control of blood pressure to limit the 
      development of cardiovascular complications. The introduction of the angiotensin 
      II type I (AT1)-receptor blockers was an important breakthrough, offering 
      effective control of blood pressure with placebo-like tolerability. The 
      relationship between dose and antihypertensive effect has been more or less well 
      defined for the different AT1-receptor blockers currently available. Attempts to 
      compare the antihypertensive effects of different AT1-receptor blockers using 
      meta-analyses of several studies have been performed, although the results of 
      such analyses are often limited by the inconsistencies of included trials and the 
      inability to examine primary data and methodology. Furthermore, it is important 
      to include data from the most up-to-date studies and to ensure correction of 
      placebo effects, which tend to differ considerably between studies and contribute 
      in varying degrees to the apparent therapeutic efficacies observed. Consequently, 
      while meta-analysis can be useful in determining dose-response relationships for 
      individual drugs, randomized, prospective, double-blind, head-to-head comparative 
      studies are the only accurate means of comparing efficacy between drugs. A number 
      of such trials have confirmed the superior efficacy of candesartan cilexetil and 
      irbesartan compared with losartan in terms of reduction in blood pressure and 
      maintenance of antihypertensive efficacy between doses.

PG  - 18-25
AB  - A "cocktail" approach, which involves simultaneous administration of multiple 
      CYP-specific probes, concurrently detects the activity of multiple CYP enzymes. 
      We developed and validated a rapid and selective LC-MS/MS method for determining 
      the plasma concentrations of 5 CYP probe drugs and metabolites 
      (caffeine/paraxanthine, CYP1A2 substrate; losartan/losartan carboxylic acid 
      (E3174), CYP2C9 substrate; omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole, CYP2C19 substrate; 
      dextromethorphan/dextrorphan, CYP2D6 substrate; and 
      midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam, CYP3A4 substrate) by single-step extraction, 
      followed by a single LC-MS/MS run. An Ostro™ 96-well plate was used for 
      extraction of CYP substrates and metabolites from human plasma and urine. 
      Following optimization of the chromatographic conditions, all the peaks were well 
      separated, and retention times ranged between 4.4 and 11.7 min. The total run 
      time for a single injection was within 13 min. The accuracy and precision values 
      suggested that the assay had high accuracy and reliability in plasma and urine 
      samples. No significant matrix interference was observed. To demonstrate the 
      efficacy of this method, plasma and urine concentrations of 5 CYP probe 
      substrates and their metabolites were determined after simultaneous oral 
      administration of 5 drugs to 4 healthy volunteers. All the substrates and 
      metabolites were detected over an 8 h period, and the plasma concentrations of 
      each substrate at 8 h after administration were above the lower limit of 
      quantification. Urine concentrations of drugs and their metabolic ratio were 
      evaluated after the administration. In conclusion, the advantage of our cocktail 
      approach is that it enables in vivo assessment of the activity of various 
      drug-metabolizing enzymes in a single assay.

AB  - An ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
      (U-HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated to determine irbesartan (IRB) 
      and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in human plasma simultaneously. Plasma samples 
      were prepared using protein precipitation with acetonitrile, the two analytes and 
      the internal standard losartan were separated on an Acquity U-HPLC BEH C18 column 
      and mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a QTrap5500 mass spectrometer 
      coupled with an electro-spray ionization (ESI) source in the negative ion mode. 
      The MRM transitions of m/z 427.2→206.9 and m/z 296.1→204.9 were used to quantify 
      for IRB and HCTZ, respectively. The linearity of this method was found to be 
      within the concentration range of 5-3000ng/mL for IRB, and 0.5-300ng/mL for HCTZ 
      in human plasma, respectively. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
      5ng/mL and 0.5ng/mL for IRB and HCTZ in human plasma, respectively. The relative 
      standard deviations (RSD) of intra and inter precision were less than 12% for 
      both IRB and HCTZ. The analysis time of per sample was 2.5min. The developed and 
      validated method was successfully applied to a bioequivalence study of IRB 
      (300mg) with HCTZ (12.5mg) tablet in Chinese healthy volunteers (N=20).

AB  - The diabecon is an ayurvedic herbal formulation that contains a mixture of herbs 
      traditionally used as antidiabetic which is reported in the ayurvedic 
      pharmacopeia of India and Indian Materia medica. The diabetic population has a 
      common co-morbidity of hypertension for which losartan drug is commonly used for 
      the treatment of hypertension. However, there is a lack of research on the 
      pharmacokinetics interaction between diabecon and losartan. This research aims to 
      investigate the influence of diabecon on the pharmacokinetics of losartan drugs 
      in rats by establishing a highly sensitive ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method. 
      The method was validated according to the USFDA guidelines and was applied for 
      the pharmacokinetic study. The lowest concentration of losartan detection in rat 
      plasma was found to be 1 ng/mL and the accuracy and precision were within the 
      linear range (1-1500 ng/mL). The results revealed that after 28 days of dosing 
      diabecon, it has altered the pharmacokinetic parameters like area under the curve 
      (AUC(0-t)), drug clearance (Cl/F), and rate of elimination (Ke) of losartan, 
      which may happen due to enzyme induction. Although there was a change in the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan when administered in the presence of 
      diabecon, it was found to be nonsignificant in rats (p > 0.05). According to the 
      best of our knowledge, this is the first article that discusses the 
      pharmacokinetic herb-drug interaction between diabecon and losartan.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptors modulate muscle microvascular and metabolic responses to 
      insulin in vivo.
PG  - 2939-46
LID - 10.2337/db10-1691 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin (ANG) II interacts with insulin-signaling pathways to 
      regulate insulin sensitivity. The type 1 (AT(1)R) and type 2 (AT(2)R) receptors 
      reciprocally regulate basal perfusion of muscle microvasculature. Unopposed 
      AT(2)R activity increases muscle microvascular blood volume (MBV) and glucose 
      extraction, whereas unopposed AT(1)R activity decreases both. The current study 
      examined whether ANG II receptors modulate muscle insulin delivery and 
      sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overnight-fasted rats were studied. In 
      protocol 1, rats received a 2-h infusion of saline, insulin (3 mU/kg/min), 
      insulin plus PD123319 (AT(2)R blocker), or insulin plus losartan (AT(1)R blocker, 
      intravenously). Muscle MBV, microvascular flow velocity, and microvascular blood 
      flow (MBF) were determined. In protocol 2, rats received (125)I-insulin with or 
      without PD123319, and muscle insulin uptake was determined. RESULTS: Insulin 
      significantly increased muscle MBV and MBF. AT(2)R blockade abolished 
      insulin-mediated increases in muscle MBV and MBF and decreased insulin-stimulated 
      glucose disposal by ~30%. In contrast, losartan plus insulin increased muscle MBV 
      by two- to threefold without further increasing insulin-stimulated glucose 
      disposal. Plasma nitric oxide increased by >50% with insulin and insulin plus 
      losartan but not with insulin plus PD123319. PD123319 markedly decreased muscle 
      insulin uptake and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that both AT(1)Rs and AT(2)Rs regulate insulin's microvascular and 
      metabolic action in muscle. Although AT(1)R activity restrains muscle metabolic 
      responses to insulin via decreased microvascular recruitment and insulin 
      delivery, AT(2)R activity is required for normal microvascular responses to 
      insulin. Thus, pharmacologic manipulation aimed at increasing the 
      AT(2)R-to-AT(1)R activity ratio may afford the potential to improve muscle 
      insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.

PG  - 1579-84
AB  - Cyclosporine-drug interactions in adult transplant patients and the impact of age 
      were studied. The medical records of transplant patients receiving cyclosporine 
      therapy were identified. Data on patient demographics, cyclosporine dosages, 
      dosage form, blood trough concentrations, clinical laboratory test values, and 
      concurrent medications were collected. One-compartment models for oral and i.v. 
      administration were used to fit cyclosporine concentration data to population 
      pharmacokinetic and statistical models. Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM) 
      software was used. The influence of covariates, including but not limited to 
      concomitant medications and age, on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics was evaluated. 
      The records of 100 patients (36 women and 64 men) were reviewed. A mean +/- S.D. 
      of 9 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 1 medications per day were consumed by patients < 60 and > 
      or = 60 years old, respectively. Mean population pharmacokinetic values of 0.407 
      L/hr/kg for clearance, 4.0 L/kg for volume of distribution, 31% for 
      bioavailability, and 10.6 hours for half-life were determined on the basis of 569 
      blood cyclosporine levels. Twelve medications (sertraline, losartan, valsartan, 
      quinine, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, alendronate, 
      digoxin, acyclovir, and oxycodone) with previously unconfirmed pharmacokinetic 
      interactions with cyclosporine were identified as interacting. There was no 
      correlation between age and interactions. Patients taking cyclosporine were at 
      risk for pharmacokinetic drug interactions when cyclosporine was used in 
      combination with sertraline, losartan, valsartan, quinine, atorvastatin, 
      simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, alendronate, digoxin, acyclovir, and 
      oxycodone. Transplant patients 60-75 years of age had cyclosporine-drug 
      interactions similar to those in younger patients.

TI  - Diverse effects of Ace inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists on 
      prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and collagen distribution in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats.
PG  - 373-81
AB  - This study has compared the effects of two structurally different angiotensin 
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) such as zofenopril (Zof, with sulfhydrylic 
      group) and lisinopril (Lis, with carboxylic group) and an angiotensin II AT(1) 
      receptor antagonist (losartan, Los) on the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and 
      collagen distribution in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The SHRs were 
      untreated or received: Zof (10 mg/kg/day), Lis (10 mg/kg/day) or Los (20 
      mg/kg/day) in drinking water starting at 4 weeks of age. At 8, 16 and 24 weeks of 
      age, 8 rats/group were sacrificed for determination of blood pressure, cardiac 
      hypertrophy and collagen distribution. All treatments significantly decreased 
      blood pressure and cardiac indices, expressed as the ventricles to body weight 
      ratio, both variables being significantly correlated. Total ventricular collagen 
      content was similarly decreased in all treated groups. Zof significantly 
      increased the expression of collagen type III and normalized the collagen type 
      I/III ratio. These results suggest that the effects of these drugs on different 
      types of collagen are independent from angiotensin II formation. Similar findings 
      obtained with captopril seem to indicate that the antioxidant sulfhydrylic group 
      of these ACEis can play a role in the distribution of collagen during cardiac 
      hypertrophy.

TI  - Localized accumulation of angiotensin II and production of angiotensin-(1-7) in 
      rat luteal cells and effects on steroidogenesis.
PG  - E221-33
AB  - These studies aim to investigate subcellular distribution of angiotensin II (ANG 
      II) in rat luteal cells, identify other bioactive angiotensin peptides, and 
      investigate a role for angiotensin peptides in luteal steroidogenesis. Confocal 
      microscopy showed ANG II distributed within the cytoplasm and nuclei of luteal 
      cells. HPLC analysis showed peaks that eluted with the same retention times as 
      ANG-(1-7), ANG II, and ANG III. Their relative concentrations were ANG II >or= 
      ANG-(1-7) > ANG III, and accumulation was modulated by quinapril, an inhibitor of 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Z-proprolinal (ZPP), an inhibitor of prolyl 
      endopeptidase (PEP), and parachloromercurylsulfonic acid (PCMS), an inhibitor of 
      sulfhydryl protease. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease 
      inhibitor, did not affect peptide accumulation. Quinapril, ZPP, PCMS, and PMSF, 
      as well as losartan and PD-123319, the angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) and type 
      2 (AT2) receptor antagonists, were used in progesterone production studies. ZPP 
      significantly reduced luteinizing hormone (LH)-dependent progesterone production 
      (P < 0.05). Quinapril plus ZPP had a greater inhibitory effect on LH-stimulated 
      progesterone than either inhibitor alone, but this was not reversed by exogenous 
      ANG II or ANG-(1-7). Both PCMS and PMSF acutely blocked LH-stimulated 
      progesterone, and PCMS blocked LH-sensitive cAMP accumulation. Losartan inhibited 
      progesterone production in permeabilized but not intact luteal cells and was 
      reversed by ANG II. PD-123319 had no significant effect on luteal progesterone 
      production in either intact or permeabilized cells. These data suggest that 
      steroidogenesis may be modulated by angiotensin peptides that act in part through 
      intracellular AT1 receptors.

TI  - Resveratrol modulates drug- and carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes in a healthy 
      volunteer study.
PG  - 1168-75
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-09-0155 [doi]
AB  - Resveratrol has been shown to exhibit cancer-preventive activities in preclinical 
      studies. We conducted a clinical study to determine the effect of pharmacologic 
      doses of resveratrol on drug- and carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes. Forty-two 
      healthy volunteers underwent baseline assessment of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 
      phase II detoxification enzymes. CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzyme 
      activities were measured by the metabolism of caffeine, dextromethorphan, 
      losartan, and buspirone, respectively. Blood lymphocyte glutathione S-transferase 
      (GST) activity and GST-pi level and serum total and direct bilirubin, a surrogate 
      for UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 activity, were measured to assess 
      phase II enzymes. After the baseline evaluation, study participants took 1 g of 
      resveratrol once daily for 4 weeks. Enzyme assessment was repeated upon 
      intervention completion. Resveratrol intervention was found to inhibit the 
      phenotypic indices of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9 and to induce the phenotypic 
      index of 1A2. Overall, GST and UGT1A1 activities were minimally affected by the 
      intervention, although an induction of GST-pi level and UGT1A1 activity was 
      observed in individuals with low baseline enzyme level/activity. We conclude that 
      resveratrol can modulate enzyme systems involved in carcinogen activation and 
      detoxification, which may be one mechanism by which resveratrol inhibits 
      carcinogenesis. However, pharmacologic doses of resveratrol could potentially 
      lead to increased adverse drug reactions or altered drug efficacy due to 
      inhibition or induction of certain CYPs. Further clinical development of 
      resveratrol for cancer prevention should consider evaluation of lower doses of 
      resveratrol to minimize adverse metabolic drug interactions.

TI  - Localization of angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II, angiotensin II 
      receptor subtypes, and vasopressin in the mouse hypothalamus.
PG  - 218-27
AB  - The hypothalamic angiotensin II (Ang II) system plays an important role in 
      pituitary hormone release. Little is known about this system in the mouse brain. 
      We studied the distribution of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), Ang II, Ang 
      II receptor subtypes, and vasopressin in the hypothalamus of adult male mice. 
      Autoradiography of binding of the ACE inhibitor [125I]351A revealed low levels of 
      ACE throughout the hypothalamus. Ang II- and vasopressin-immunoreactive neurons 
      and fibers were detected in the paraventricular, accessory magnocellulary, and 
      supraoptic nuclei, in the retrochiasmatic part of the supraoptic nucleus and in 
      the median eminence. Autoradiography of Ang II receptors was performed using 
      [125I]Sar1-Ang II binding. Ang II receptors were present in the paraventricular, 
      suprachiasmatic, arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei, and in the median eminence. In 
      all areas [125I]Sar1-Ang II binding was displaced by the AT1 receptor antagonist 
      losartan, indicating the presence of AT1 receptors. In the paraventricular 
      nucleus [125I]Sar1-Ang II binding was displaced by Ang II (Ki = 7.6 X 10(-9)) and 
      losartan (Ki = 1.4 X 10(-7)) but also by the AT2 receptor ligand PD 123319 (Ki = 
      5.0 X 10(-7)). In addition, a low amount of AT2 receptor binding was detected in 
      the paraventricular nucleus using [125I]CGP42112 as radioligand, and the binding 
      was displaced by Ang II (Ki = 2.4 X 10(-9)), CGP42112 (Ki = 7.9 x 10(-10)), and 
      PD123319 (Ki = 2.2 x 10(-7)). ACE, Ang II, and AT1 as well as AT2 receptor 
      subtypes are present in the mouse hypothalamus. Our data are the basis for 
      further studies on the mouse brain Ang II system.

TI  - Interactions between angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists and second-generation 
      antiepileptic drugs in the test of maximal electroshock.
PG  - 277-83
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12023 [doi]
AB  - The anticonvulsant activity of angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, losartan 
      (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenil-4-yl)methyl]imidazole) 
      and telmisartan 
      (49-[(1,49-dimethyl-29-propyl[2,69-bi-1H-benzimidazo]-19-yl)methyl]-[1,19-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic 
      acid), has been reported recently. It is suggested that AT1 receptor antagonists 
      may affect the protective action of antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this study 
      was to determine the influence of losartan and telmisartan on the anticonvulsant 
      activity of some second-generation antiepileptics (lamotrigine - LTG, 
      oxcarbazepine - OXC, and topiramate - TPM). For this purpose, the maximal 
      electroshock seizure (MES) test in mice was used. Additionally, the drug 
      combinations were checked for adverse effects in the passive avoidance and 
      chimney tests. In the MES test, losartan at the doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg, 
      administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), potentiated the protective action of LTG 
      (P < 0.01). This interaction was not accompanied by a significant change of LTG 
      level either in plasma or in the brain. Telmisartan at the dose of 30 mg/kg i.p. 
      enhanced the anticonvulsant action of TPM (P < 0.01). However, this interaction 
      was pharmacokinetic in nature, as telmisartan significantly increased plasma and 
      total brain concentrations of TPM (P < 0.001). The combinations of AT1 receptor 
      antagonists with antiepileptic drugs did not affect retention in the passive 
      avoidance test or motor coordination in the chimney test. The potentiation of the 
      anticonvulsant action of LTG by losartan probably on account of pharmacodynamic 
      interactions, make this combination important for further experimental and 
      clinical studies. The combination of telmisartan and TPM is less beneficial due 
      to pharmacokinetic interactions.

TI  - Angiotensin II binding and extracellular matrix remodelling in a rat model of 
      myocardial infarction.
PG  - 369-78
AB  - Clinical evidence points to a role for angiotensin II (Ang II) in the 
      post-infarction remodelling of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study was 
      designed to investigate the remodelling process in an animal model of myocardial 
      infarction (MI) using the following criteria: 1) histological studies to examine 
      the re-vascularisation process and collagen deposition in different regions of 
      the myocardium; 2) histological evidence to investigate the cell type 
      distribution using cell-specific markers; 3) histological and Western blot 
      analysis to localise Ang II receptor subtypes (AT(1)-receptor and AT(2)-receptor) 
      and to study their regulation; 4) kinetics of the binding of Ang II to its 
      receptors in a heart perfusion model; and 5) to assess the effect of the Ang II 
      antagonist (losartan) on these parameters. MI was induced by ligation of the left 
      anterior descending coronary artery of Sprague-Dawley rats. Four different animal 
      groups were established: 1) sham-operated, non-treated; 2) sham-operated, treated 
      with losartan; 3) myocardial infarct, non-treated; and 4) myocardial infarct, 
      treated with losartan. In infarcted rat hearts, fibroblasts and collagen types I 
      and III increased in the remnant viable region of the left ventricle compared 
      with sham-operated rats. One month of losartan treatment in myocardial infarcted 
      rats revealed insignificant changes in fibroblasts and collagen types I and III 
      compared with sham controls. Also, myocardial infarction increased AT(1)-receptor 
      protein levels compared with sham-operated controls, as judged by Western 
      blotting. In losartan-treated myocardial infarct animals, no changes were 
      detected at the level of AT(1)-receptor expression compared with non-treated 
      myocardial infarct rats. Binding studies of Ang II on endothelial cell lining and 
      directly on myocytes in sham-operated and infarcted perfused rat hearts revealed 
      that, in myocardial infarcted-animals, Ang II binding affinity increased both in 
      the endothelium and in myofibres. This may be considered a major putative effect 
      of the peptide in potentiating the pharmacodynamics of hypertrophy. In 
      losartan-treated myocardial infarcted-animals, a marked increase in the binding 
      affinities of Ang II for the AT(2)-receptor subtype was observed. Hence, 
      potential cardioprotective effects of the AT(1)-receptor antagonist are proposed.

TI  - Drug metabolism in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A phenotyping 
      cocktail study.
PG  - 4397-4407
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14862 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effect of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) on drug metabolism by comparing the pharmacokinetics of patients with 
      severe COPD with healthy volunteers and using the modified Inje drug cocktail. 
      METHODS: This was a single-centre pharmacokinetic study with 12 healthy 
      participants and 7 participants with GOLD D COPD. Midazolam 1 mg, 
      dextromethorphan 30 mg, losartan 25 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, caffeine 130 mg and 
      paracetamol 1000 mg were simultaneously administered and intensive 
      pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted over 8 hours. Drug metabolism by CYP3A4, 
      CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 in participants with COPD were 
      compared with phenotypes in healthy controls. RESULTS: The oral clearance (95% 
      confidence interval) in participants with COPD relative to controls was: 
      midazolam 63% (60-67%); dextromethorphan 72% (40-103%); losartan 53% (52-55%); 
      omeprazole 35% (31-39%); caffeine 52% (50-53%); and paracetamol 73% (72-74%). 
      There was a 5-fold increase in AUC for omeprazole and approximately 2-fold 
      increases for caffeine, losartan, dextromethorphan, and midazolam. The AUC of 
      paracetamol, which is mostly glucuronidated, was increased by about 60%. 
      CONCLUSION: Severe COPD is associated with a clinically significant reduction in 
      oral drug clearance. This may be greater for cytochrome P450 substrates than for 
      glucuronidated drugs. This supports reduced starting doses when prescribing for 
      patients with severe COPD.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Drug Interaction of Allisartan Isoproxil and Indapamide 
      Sustained-Release Formulation.
PG  - 1051-1059
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1321 [doi]
AB  - Allisartan isoproxil (AI) is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker and be 
      converted into the active substance EXP3174 in vivo. We evaluated the drug-drug 
      interactions of AI and an indapamide sustained-release (Ind SR) preparation, as 
      well as the pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of AI and Ind SR in 
      healthy subjects. The trial was set up in 6 sequences and 3 cycles, and each 
      cycle contained a 7-day washout period. Subjects received 3 different trial drugs 
      (A, AI; B, Ind SR; C, AI + Ind SR) during 3 different cycles. Twenty-four 
      subjects were enrolled in the clinical trial. Of these, 22 completed the study, 2 
      subjects dropped out due to adverse events (AEs). For subjects given AI alone or 
      combined with Ind SR, the pharmacogenetic parameters C(max) and the geometric 
      mean ratio of steady state (combined/single) of EXP3174 was 130%. The geometric 
      mean ratio of area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval at 
      steady state (combined/single use) was 144.5%. Therefore, the combination of Ind 
      SR had an impact on the pharmacokinetics of AI. Then, the results indicated that 
      the AI combination had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Ind SR. Serious AEs 
      did not occur. The AEs in this clinical trial were the same as those for AI and 
      Ind SR. Combined administration resulted in 2 cases (2 subjects) of Grade 3 
      hypotension and 1 case of Grade 3 hypotension with AI alone. Considering that 
      this trial included healthy volunteers, the risk of hypotension was expected to 
      be manageable.

AB  - AIMS: Iron overload in animal models and humans increases oxidative stress and 
      induces cardiomyopathy. It has been suggested that the vasculature is also 
      damaged, but the impacts on vascular reactivity and the underlying mechanisms 
      remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify possible changes in 
      the vascular reactivity of aortas from iron overloaded rats and investigate the 
      underlying mechanisms. MAIN METHODS: Rats were treated with 100mg/kg/day 
      iron-dextran, ip, five days a week for four weeks and compared to a 
      saline-injected group. KEY FINDINGS: Chronic iron administration increased serum 
      iron and transferrin saturation with significant deposition in the liver. 
      Additionally, iron overload significantly increased the vasoconstrictor response 
      in aortic rings as assessed in vitro, with reduced influence of endothelial 
      denudation or l-NAME incubation on the vascular reactivity. In vitro assay with 
      DAF-2 indicated reduced NO production in the iron overload group. Iron 
      overload-induced vascular hyperactivity was reversed by incubation with tiron, 
      catalase, apocynin, allopurinol and losartan. Moreover, malondialdehyde was 
      elevated in the plasma, and O2(•-) generation and NADPH oxidase subunit (p22phox) 
      expression were increased in the aortas of iron-loaded rats. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      results demonstrated that chronic iron overload is associated with altered 
      vascular reactivity and the loss of endothelial modulation of the vascular tone. 
      This iron loading-induced endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide 
      bioavailability may be a result of increased production of reactive oxygen 
      species and local renin-angiotensin system activation.

AB  - In the present study, we have examined neurochemical correlates that may be 
      involved in the differential cardiovascular responses observed in normotensive 
      and hypertensive rats during stress. Using a restraint stress paradigm, both 
      normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHR) 
      underwent acute (1 h restraint in a perspex tube), chronic (1 h restraint for ten 
      consecutive days) or no restraint (control) stress. Following cessation of 
      restraint, rats were processed by incubating sections of brain stem and kidney 
      with [125I]-HO-LVA (0.03 nM) or [125I]Sar(1)Ile(8)-AngiotensinII (0.5 nM), in the 
      presence of PD123319 (10 microM) or losartan (10 microM), to determine the 
      distribution and density of vasopressin V(1A), angiotensin AT(1) and AT(2) 
      receptors, respectively. Analysis of autoradiograms indicated changes in the 
      density of radioligand binding in acutely and chronically-stressed rats, as 
      compared to controls. For example, V(1A) binding in the medial nucleus tractus 
      solitarius (SolM) decreased in the WKY but increased in the SHR. AT(1) binding in 
      SolM did not significantly change in the WKY but decreased in the SHR with 
      repeated restraint. In kidney slices, AT(1) binding decreased with stress in the 
      WKY (-17%) but increased in SHR (+10-15%). AT(2) binding in the kidney showed a 
      pattern similar to that of AT(1) binding in SHR, but not WKY. Graded increases in 
      V(1A) binding were measured in kidney medulla and cortex of both strains (+50-60% 
      with chronic restraint). These results suggest that physiological adaptation to 
      restraint is associated with specific changes in V(1A), AT(1) and AT(2) receptor 
      density within brain nuclei and kidney.

TI  - Determination and validation of LJ-2698, a potent human A(3) adenosine receptor 
      antagonist, in rat plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and 
      its application in pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 952-961
LID - 10.1007/s12272-017-0935-9 [doi]
AB  - LJ-2698, a highly potent human A(3) adenosine receptor antagonist with nucleoside 
      structure, was designed to have a minimal species dependence. For further 
      pre-clinical studies, analytical method for the detection of LJ-2698 in rat 
      plasma was developed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass. Plasma samples were 
      processed by protein precipitation method with acetonitrile, using losartan as 
      the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was carried out using a 
      Kinetex C18 column (100 × 4.6 mm; 100 Å; 2.6 μ) with acetonitrile/water with 0.2% 
      (v/v) formic acid (65:35, v/v) in the isocratic mode at a flow rate of 
      0.4 mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode was 
      performed with positive electrospray ionization. The mass transitions of LJ-2698 
      and IS were m/z 412.3 → 294.1 and m/z 423.1 → 207.2, respectively. The 
      calibration curves were linear in the range 5.00-5000 ng/mL (r (2) ≥ 0.998). The 
      lower limit of quantification was established as 5.00 ng/mL. Within- and 
      between-run precisions were <7.01%, as relative standard deviation; and 
      accuracies were in the range 3.37-3.64%, as relative error. The validated method 
      was successfully applied to its pharmacokinetic evaluation after intravenous and 
      oral administration in rats, and the dose-dependent pharmacokinetic behavior of 
      LJ-2698 was elucidated for the first time.

TI  - Effect of intratubular application of angiotensin 1-7 on nephron function.
PG  - 233-9
AB  - Cleavage of the C-terminal tripeptide of angiotensin I (Ang I) by neutral 
      endopeptidase 24.11 releases angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7). Because Ang I and neutral 
      endopeptidase 24.11 are present in proximal tubular fluid and brush border, 
      respectively, Ang 1-7 could be released into proximal tubular fluid to affect 
      nephron function. Therefore, we studied the effect of intratubular Ang 1-7 
      (10(-12) to 10(-8) M) on nephron function employing in vivo renal micropuncture 
      in inactin-anesthetized Munich-Wistar-Frömter rats. We observed that: (i) 
      Intratubular application of Ang 1-7 for 3, 15, or 30 min did not affect 
      reabsorption in the microperfused proximal convoluted tubule determined as net 
      fluid reabsorption. (ii) During perfusion of Henle's loop for 15 min with 
      artificial tubular fluid (time control), we observed a decline in fluid, 
      potassium and sodium reabsorption by 20, 18 and 5%, respectively. A similar 
      decline in reabsorption was seen with intratubular application of Ang 1-7 in a 
      concentration of 10(-12) or 10(-10) M. In contrast, intratubular application of 
      Ang 1-7 in a concentration of 10(-8) M increased fluid, potassium and sodium 
      reabsorption in that nephron segment by 11, 9 and 3%, respectively. The latter 
      response was completely abolished by AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      losartan (10[-6] M). (iii) Intratubular application of Ang 1-7 did not affect net 
      sodium, potassium, or fluid reabsorption in the distal tubule. (iv) TGF response 
      assessed by measuring proximal tubular stop-flow pressure or single nephron 
      filtration rate during orthograde open-loop perfusion of Henle's loop was not 
      significantly altered by intratubular application of Ang 1-7. These findings show 
      that intratubular application of Ang 1-7 in concentrations which possibly cover 
      the physiological range does not significantly alter (i) tubular reabsorption in 
      proximal convoluted or distal tubule, or (ii) TGF response. Intratubular Ang 1-7 
      at a concentration of 10(-8) M appears to increase reabsorption in Henle's loop 
      by an AT1 angiotensin II receptor-mediated mechanism, the physiological relevance 
      of which remains to be established.

TI  - Significance of changes in TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels in the progression of heart 
      failure subsequent to myocardial infarction.
PG  - H106-13
AB  - We tested whether a decrease in the ratio of interleukin-10 (IL-10) to tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) correlates with the decrease in cardiac 
      function in heart failure. It has been suggested that TNF-alpha plays a role in 
      the progression of heart failure, and the effect of TNF-alpha in many tissues is 
      modulated by IL-10. Any relation of these two cytokines to heart failure has 
      never been examined. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiographic and 
      hemodynamic techniques in coronary artery-ligated rats at 1, 4, 8, and 16 wk 
      after myocardial infarction (MI). Membrane-bound and soluble fractions of 
      TNF-alpha and IL-10 proteins, the ratio of TNF-alpha to IL-10, and TNF-alpha and 
      IL-10 mRNA levels were analyzed. Losartan was used to modify cardiac function in 
      rats 4 wk after MI to further validate the relation between the 
      IL-10-to-TNF-alpha ratio and cardiac function. Cardiac function deteriorated with 
      time in all coronary artery-ligated groups, with severe failure at 16 wk after 
      MI. Membrane-bound and soluble TNF-alpha protein fractions were increased 1 and 4 
      wk after MI, whereas TNF-alpha mRNA was increased 4 and 8 wk after MI. 
      Membrane-bound IL-10 protein and mRNA levels were decreased 4, 8, and 16 wk after 
      MI. The decrease in the IL-10-to-TNF-alpha protein ratio in all coronary 
      artery-ligated groups correlated with the depressed cardiac function. Losartan 
      improved cardiac function, membrane-bound and soluble TNF-alpha and IL-10 protein 
      levels, the ratio of IL-10 to TNF-alpha, and IL-10 mRNA. This study suggests that 
      a decrease in IL-10 and IL-10-to-TNF-alpha ratio correlates with depressed 
      cardiac function.

TI  - Angiotensin II type 2 receptor-mediated duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion in 
      the rat.
PG  - G1254-60
AB  - The aims of this study were to elucidate the distribution of angiotensin 
      receptors (AT(1) and AT(2)) in the duodenal wall and to investigate whether AT(2) 
      receptors are involved in the regulation of duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion, 
      which is of importance for the mucosal defense against gastric acid. 
      Immunohistochemistry was used to locate AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in 
      chloralose-anesthetized rats. Duodenal mucosal alkaline output was measured by 
      use of in situ pH-stat titration. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a distinct 
      staining for both AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in the lamina propria of the villi 
      and also for AT(1) receptors in the muscularis interna. When angiotensin II was 
      infused in the presence of the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan, mucosal 
      alkaline secretion increased by ~50%. This response was inhibited by the AT(2) 
      receptor antagonist PD-123319. The AT(2) receptor agonist CGP-42112A increased 
      mucosal alkaline secretion by ~50%. This increase was absent in the presence of 
      PD-123319 but not in the presence of losartan or the local anesthetic lidocaine. 
      We conclude that angiotensin II stimulates duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion by 
      activation of AT(2) receptors located in the duodenal mucosa/submucosa.

AB  - Polypill is a medication designed for preventing heart attacks through a 
      combination of drugs. Current formulations contain blood pressure-lowering drugs 
      and others, such statins or acetylsalicylic acid. These drugs exhibit different 
      physical chemical features, and consequently different release kinetics. 
      Therefore, the concentration in plasma of some of them after the release process 
      can be out of the therapeutic range. This paper investigates a new methodology 
      for the control dosage of a polypill recently reported containing 
      hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, losartan and simvastatin in a 12.5/2.5/25/40 
      weight ratio. The procedure is based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) 
      with MCM-41 structure (MSN-41) used as carrier, aimed to control release of the 
      four drugs included in the polypill. In vitro release data were obtained by HPLC 
      and the curves adjusted with a kinetic model. To explain the release results, a 
      molecular model was built to determine the drug-matrix interactions, and quantum 
      mechanical calculations were performed to obtain the electrostatic properties of 
      each drug. Amlodipine, losartan and simvastatin were released from the 
      polypill-MSN-41 system in a controlled way. This would be a favourable behavior 
      when used clinically because avoid too quick pressure decrease. However, the 
      diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was quickly released from our system in the first 
      minutes, as is needed in hypertensive urgencies. In addition, an increase in the 
      stability of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in the polypill-MSN-41 
      system. Therefore, the new way of polypill dosage proposed can result in a safer 
      and effective treatment.

TI  - Pericryptal myofibroblast growth in rat descending colon induced by low-sodium 
      diets is mediated by aldosterone and not by angiotensin II.
PG  - 53-9
AB  - Pericryptal myofibroblast growth in descending colonic crypts correlates with the 
      activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Earlier work showed that 
      during the transition from a high-Na(+) (HS) to low-Na(+) (LS) diet there are 
      changes in the colonic crypt wall and pericryptal sheath. As LS diet increases 
      both aldosterone and angiotensin II, the aim here was to determine their 
      individual contributions to the trophic changes in colonic crypts. Experiments 
      were conducted on control and adrenalectomized Sprague-Dawley rats fed an HS diet 
      and then switched to LS diet for 3 days and supplemented with aldosterone or 
      angiotensin II. The actions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
      captopril, the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan and the aldosterone 
      antagonist spironolactone on extracellular matrix proteins, claudin 4 and 
      E-cadherin myofibroblast proteins, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and 
      OB-cadherin (cadherin 11), angiotensin type 1 and TGFbetar1 membrane receptors 
      were determined by immunolocalization in fixed distal colonic mucosa. The LS diet 
      or aldosterone supplementation following ADX in HS or LS increased extracellular 
      matrix, membrane receptors and myofibroblast proteins, but angiotensin alone had 
      no trophic effect on alpha-SMA. These results show that aldosterone stimulates 
      myofibroblast growth in the distal colon independently of dietary Na(+) intake 
      and of angiotensin levels. This stimulus could be a genomic response or secondary 
      to stretch of the pericryptal sheath myofibroblasts accompanying enhanced rates 
      of crypt fluid absorption.

TI  - ANG II-dependent HCO3- reabsorption in surviving rat distal tubules: 
      expression/activation of H(+)-ATPase.
PG  - F799-808
AB  - Distal tubules (DT) from sham or five-sixths nephrectomized (Nx) rats were 
      perfused in vivo to evaluate the hypothesis that, after Nx, endogenous 
      angiotensin II (ANG II) modulates DT in vivo bicarbonate reabsorption (JtCO2) via 
      H(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) and Na+/H+ exchange. In Nx rats JtCO2 
      was increased (65 +/- 7 vs. -24 +/- 21 pmol.min-1.mm-1, P < 0.01). Both luminal 
      and intravenous AT1-receptor blockade by losartan reduced Nx DT JtCO2 (41 +/- 6 
      and 34 +/- 4 pmol.min-1.min-1, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas neither 10(-9) M 
      nor 10(-11) M ANG II luminal perfusion increased JtCO2, suggesting preexisting 
      high endogenous ANG II levels. The Na+/H+ antiporter inhibitors 
      5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride and 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride were without 
      effect. Luminal perfusion of 5 nM concanamycin A, a V-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor, 
      reduced Nx DT JtCO2 (45 +/- 8 pmol.min-1.mm-1, P < 0.05). In Nx A-type 
      intercalated cells, we demonstrated cellular hypertrophy, elaboration of apical 
      microplicae, and enhanced expression/apical polarization of H(+)-ATPase. Thus ANG 
      II is an important determinant in sustaining brisk DT JtCO2 following Nx and is 
      associated with enhanced expression and A-type intercalated cell apical 
      polarization of H(+)-ATPase.

TI  - Angiotensin-II is a putative neurotransmitter in lactate-induced panic-like 
      responses in rats with disruption of GABAergic inhibition in the dorsomedial 
      hypothalamus.
PG  - 9205-15
AB  - Intravenous sodium lactate infusions or the noradrenergic agent yohimbine 
      reliably induce panic attacks in humans with panic disorder but not in healthy 
      controls. However, the exact mechanism of lactate eliciting a panic attack is 
      still unknown. In rats with chronic disruption of GABA-mediated inhibition in the 
      dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), achieved by chronic microinfusion of the glutamic 
      acid decarboxylase inhibitor L-allylglycine, sodium lactate infusions or 
      yohimbine elicits panic-like responses (i.e., anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, 
      and tachypnea). In the present study, previous injections of the angiotensin-II 
      (A-II) type 1 receptor antagonist losartan and the nonspecific A-II receptor 
      antagonist saralasin into the DMH of "panic-prone" rats blocked the anxiety-like 
      and physiological components of lactate-induced panic-like responses. In 
      addition, direct injections of A-II into the DMH of these panic-prone rats also 
      elicited panic-like responses that were blocked by pretreatment with saralasin. 
      Microinjections of saralasin into the DMH did not block the panic-like responses 
      elicited by intravenous infusions of the noradrenergic agent yohimbine or by 
      direct injections of NMDA into the DMH. The presence of the A-II type 1 receptors 
      in the region of the DMH was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry. Thus, these 
      results implicate A-II pathways and the A-II receptors in the hypothalamus as 
      putative substrates for sodium lactate-induced panic-like responses in vulnerable 
      subjects.

AB  - Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system improves morbidity and mortality of 
      patients with cardiovascular diseases, e.g. arterial hypertension, renal failure, 
      following myocardial infarction and in congestive heart failure. The angiotensin 
      II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs), 
      i.e. losartan, eprosartan, irbesartan and valsartan were developed by 
      computer-based molecule design. Early observations already indicate that the ARBs 
      elicit pleiotropic effects developing anti-aggregatory, anti-inflammatory and 
      anti-mitogenic effects independent from their actions at the AT(1) receptor. 
      Losartan metabolism indicates a number of known active intermediates and pointed 
      to further interactions of these derivatives with other receptors and cellular 
      signaling systems. Here we discuss a compilation of detailed pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic data of active metabolites of ARBs indicating their mode of 
      action and suggest novel therapeutic implications. The clinical observations that 
      ARBs elicit potencies in patients with cardiovascular diseases via the regulation 
      of inflammatory, growth and homeostatic factors lead us to focus on specific, 
      reactive metabolites, which hold potential for future indications and possible 
      drug interactions in cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Evaluation of the relationship between sex, polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9,

AB  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are used to treat hypertension. Most ARBs 
      are metabolized by CYP2C9. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible 
      association between sex, polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genes, and the 
      pharmacokinetics of losartan, valsartan, candesartan, and telmisartan. The study 
      population comprised 246 healthy volunteers from seven single-dose clinical 
      trials: 64 from two candesartan studies, 43 from a telmisartan study, 36 from a 
      losartan study, and 103 from three valsartan studies. DNA was extracted from 
      blood samples and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 (CYP2C8*2, 
      CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4, CYP2C8*5) and CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3) genes were 
      evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Sex only affected 
      telmisartan pharmacokinetics, since women showed a higher telmisartan C(max) than 
      men (590.5 ± 75.8 ng/ml versus 282.1 ± 30.8 ng/ml; P ≤ 0.01). CYP2C9 variants 
      were associated only with losartan pharmacokinetics: the half-life of losartan 
      was higher in CYP2C9*3 allele carriers (3.1 ± 0.4 hours) than in volunteers with 
      the wild-type genotype (2.3 ± 0.1 hours) (P ≤ 0.05). CYP2C8 polymorphisms were 
      associated only with valsartan pharmacokinetics, since *2 allele carriers showed 
      faster clearance (1.07 ± 0.57 l/h·kg) than those with the wild-type genotype 
      (0.48 ± 0.72 l/h·kg; P ≤ 0.01) and carriers of the *3 allele (0.35 ± 0.49 l/h·kg; 
      P ≤ 0.001). These results suggest that genotypes for CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 are 
      relevant to the pharmacokinetics of losartan and valsartan, respectively, but not 
      the pharmacokinetics of candesartan or telmisartan.

TI  - Angiotensin type 2 receptor in pancreatic islets of adult rats: a novel 
      insulinotropic mediator.
PG  - E1281-91
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00286.2013 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the relative abundance of angiotensin type 2 
      receptor (AT2R) protein in various tissues of adult rats. We found that 
      pancreatic islets expressed the highest AT2R protein compared with all other 
      tissues. Accordingly, we then determined the functional significance of AT2R in 
      the endocrine pancreas in in vivo and in vitro experiments by using angiotensin 
      II (ANG II) alone, losartan (Los; AT1R antagonist), compound 21 (C21; AT2R 
      agonist), and PD-123319 (PD; AT2R antagonist). Experiments carried out in rats 
      indicated that, 1) ANG II treatment significantly increased plasma insulin 
      concentration (1.51 ± 0.20 vs. 0.82 ± 0.14 ng/ml, n = 7, P < 0.05) in the fed 
      state. This insulinotropic effect was further augmented by combined treatment 
      with ANG II + Los (2.31 ± 0.25 ng/ml, n = 7, P < 0.01). C21 also elevated insulin 
      levels (2.13 ± 0.20 ng/ml, n = 7, P < 0.01), which was completely abolished by 
      PD. 2) ANG II impaired glucose tolerance, whereas ANG II + Los or C21 improved 
      this function. 3) All treated rats displayed an enhanced insulin secretory 
      response to a glucose challenge. 4) All treated rats displayed upregulated 
      proinsulin 2 mRNA and insulin protein expression in the pancreas. In in vitro 
      experiments using INS-1E cells and isolated rat islets, we found that AT2R 
      activation significantly improved insulin biosynthesis and secretion. These 
      results suggest that the AT2R functions as an insulinotropic mediator. AT2R and 
      its downstream signaling pathways may be potential therapeutic targets for 
      diabetes.

TI  - Blood pressure-decreasing effect of etamicastat alone and in combination with 
      antihypertensive drugs in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
PG  - 30-8
LID - 10.1038/hr.2014.143 [doi]
AB  - Hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system has an important role in the 
      development and progression of arterial hypertension. This study evaluated the 
      efficacy of etamicastat, a dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH) inhibitor, in controlling 
      high blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), either alone or 
      in combination with other classes of antihypertensives. SHRs were administered 
      with etamicastat by gavage, and its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
      properties were evaluated. Etamicastat induced a time-dependent decrease in 
      noradrenaline-to-dopamine ratios in the heart and kidney, and had no effect on 
      catecholamine levels in the frontal cortex of SHRs. Cardiovascular 
      pharmacodynamic effects following administration of etamicastat alone or in 
      combination with other classes of antihypertensive drugs were assessed by 
      telemetry. Etamicastat was evaluated in combination with captopril, losartan, 
      hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, prazosin and/or diltiazem. Etamicastat 
      monotherapy induced a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure without reflex 
      tachycardia. Combination therapy amplified the antihypertensive effects of all 
      tested drugs. In conclusion, inhibition of peripheral DβH with etamicastat, as a 
      monotherapy or combination therapy, may constitute a valid alternative treatment 
      for high blood pressure.

TI  - Betaxolol-induced deterioration of asthma and a pharmacodynamic analysis based on 
      beta-receptor occupancy.
PG  - 358-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of deterioration of asthma associated with continuous 
      use of oral betaxolol, a beta1-selective beta-blocking agent. We also analyzed 
      the pharmacokinetics in this case by applying a receptor occupancy model. CASE 
      SUMMARY: A 68-year-old woman taking 5 mg of betaxolol for hypertension 
      occasionally experienced asthmatic coughing after upper respiratory tract 
      infection. Two years after the start of betaxolol, her asthma gradually worsened. 
      Although pharmacotherapy for asthma was introduced, betaxolol was continued. 
      Finally, she was admitted to hospital with bronchospasm. When she was discharged 
      after 2 months, betaxolol was discontinued and losartan potassium (25 mg/d) was 
      initiated instead for her hypertension. Since then, she has been free from 
      bronchospasm. METHOD: We calculated the mean receptor occupancy (phiSS) of the 
      beta1- and beta2-receptors after the usual oral dose of betaxolol by using 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the literature. We 
      estimated the decrease in the exercise pulse rate or the forced expiratory volume 
      in 1 second (FEV1) by applying the phiSS values to the model previously reported 
      by us. RESULTS: Betaxolol seems less likely than other beta1-blocking agents to 
      cause pulmonary adverse effects. However, the estimated decrease in FEV1 after 
      oral administration of betaxolol (5 mg) was close to that after oral bisoprolol 
      (5 mg), which has been reported to induce asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Oral betaxolol may 
      induce bronchospasm, although betaxolol is considered to be highly 
      cardioselective and seems less likely than other beta1-selective blocking agents 
      to cause pulmonary adverse effects. Betaxolol should be administered with caution 
      to patients with asthma or chronic pulmonary disease.

TI  - Pediatric Cytochrome P450 Activity Alterations in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.
PG  - 1317-1325
LID - 10.1124/dmd.117.077644 [doi]
AB  - Variable drug responses depend on individual variation in the activity of 
      drug-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). As the most 
      common chronic liver disease in children and adults, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
      (NASH) has been identified as a source of significant interindividual variation 
      in hepatic drug metabolism. Compared with adults, children present age-related 
      differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine the impact of fatty liver disease severity on the activity of a 
      variety of CYP enzymes in children and adolescents. Healthy and nonalcoholic 
      fatty liver disease pediatric subjects aged 12-21 years inclusive received an 
      oral cocktail of four probe drugs: caffeine (CYP1A2, 100 mg), omeprazole 
      (CYP2C19, 20 mg), losartan (CYP2C9, 25 mg), and midazolam (CYP3A4, 2 mg). Venous 
      blood and urine were collected before administration and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours 
      after administration. Concentrations of the parent drugs and CYP-specific 
      metabolites were quantified in plasma and urine using liquid chromatography with 
      tandem mass spectrometry. In plasma, the decreased metabolic area under the curve 
      (AUC) ratio, defined as the metabolite AUC to parent AUC, of omeprazole indicated 
      significant decreases of CYP2C19 (P = 0.002) enzymatic activities in NASH 
      adolescents, while the urine analyses did not show significant differences and 
      were highly variable. A comparison between the present in vivo pediatric studies 
      and a previous ex vivo study in adults indicates distinct differences in the 
      activities of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. These data demonstrate that pediatric NASH 
      presents an altered pattern of CYP activity and NASH should be considered as a 
      confounder of drug metabolism for certain CYP enzymes. These differences could 
      lead to future investigations that may reveal unexpected variable drug responses 
      that should be considered in pediatric dosage recommendations.

TI  - Potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions of Nigella Sativa and 
      Trigonella Foenum-graecum with losartan in L-NAME induced hypertensive rats.

AB  - The objective of this investigation was to study whether Nigella Sativa and 
      Trigonella Foenum-graecum, could modulate the losartan pharmacodynamic (PD) and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) in experimental L-NAME induced hypertensive rats. For in 
      vivo study, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of rats was measured by the 
      "tail-cuff system" after the treatment of rats with herb alone and 
      herb + losartan in hypertensive rats. The SBP of rats treated with 
      L-NAME + losartan also recorded. For the PK study, blood samples were obtained 
      for up to 12 h to determine the concentrations of the drug, and various PK 
      parameters were calculated. The data displayed that the SBP was significantly 
      (p < 0.05) decreased in the rats when administered with L-NAME + N. Sativa or 
      L-NAME + T. Foenum-graecum in contrast to the rats administered with L-NAME 
      alone. A more prominent decline (p < 0.05) in SBP was detected in rats 
      administered with L-NAME + N. Sativa + losartan and L-NAME + T. 
      Foenum-graecum + losartan. In a PK study, higher losartan C(max) and AUC(0-t) 
      were noted in rats treated with N. Sativa + losartan and T. 
      Foenum-graecum + losartan, although the difference was not significant in 
      contrast to the control group. This study proposed that the interaction between 
      N. Sativa & losartan and T. Foenum-graecum & losartan could take place on 
      concurrent administration; consequently, the dose of losartan may need to be 
      accustomed when they are utilized simultaneously.

TI  - Placental aminopeptidase A as a possible barrier of angiotensin II between mother 
      and fetus.
PG  - 621-7
AB  - Aminopeptidase A (AP-A EC 3.4.11.7), which is a membrane-bound zinc 
      metalloprotease, is present in the placenta. AP-A selectively hydrolyzes 
      N-terminal glutamyl and aspartyl residues and cleaves angiotensin II to form 
      angiotensin III. To determine the role of placental aminopeptidase A under 
      physiological and pathological conditions, we evaluated its immunolocalization 
      and enzymatic activities in the placenta. AP-A was localized in the basal zone of 
      the syncytiotrophoblast, in the membranes of the cytotrophoblast, and in fetal 
      arterioles and venules within the stem villi. AP-A activity in the microsomal 
      fraction of placental villi seemed to be remained essentially constant throughout 
      gestation. The renin-angiotensin system is considered to be accelerated in 
      pre-eclampsia. This AP-A activity was higher in pre-eclampsia (2.86+/-0.30 nmol 
      beta NA/mg protein/h) than in uncomplicated pregnancy from 28 to 41 weeks of 
      gestation (2.08+/-0.18 nmol beta NA/mg protein/h). Angiotensin II evoked AP-A 
      activity in first trimester trophoblast, and Losartan and PD 123177 in 
      combination significantly inhibited this induction of AP-A activity. The results 
      of immunohistochemical evaluation and enzymatic activity suggested that placental 
      aminopeptidase A may play a role as a component of the barrier of angiotensin II 
      between mother and fetus.

TI  - Neuron-specific expression of human angiotensinogen in brain causes increased 
      salt appetite.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the regulation 
      of cardiovascular function. In the brain, angiotensinogen (AGT) is expressed 
      mainly in astrocytes (glia) and in some neurons in regions controlling 
      cardiovascular activities. Because of the inability to dissect the functional 
      role of astrocyte- vs. neuron-derived AGT in vivo by pharmacological approaches, 
      the exact role of neuron-derived AGT in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) and 
      fluid and electrolyte balance remains unclear. Therefore, we generated a 
      transgenic mouse model overexpressing human AGT under the control of a 
      neuron-specific (synapsin I) promoter (SYN-hAGT). These mice exhibited high-level 
      expression of human AGT mRNA in the brain, with lower expression in the kidney 
      and heart. Human AGT was not detected in plasma, but in the brain it was 
      expressed exclusively in neurons. Intracerebroventricular (30 ng) but not 
      intravenous (500 ng) injection of purified human renin (hREN) caused a pressor 
      response, which was prevented by intracerebroventricular preinjection of the 
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, indicating an AT(1) 
      receptor-dependent functional role of neuron-derived AGT in the regulation of BP 
      in response to exogenous REN. Double transgenic mice expressing both the hREN 
      gene and SYN-hAGT transgene exhibited normal BP and water intake but had an 
      increased preference for salt. These data suggest that neuronal AGT may play an 
      important role in regulating salt intake and salt appetite.

TI  - Evaluation of Potential Herb-Drug Interactions Between Shengmai Injection and

PG  - 878526
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.878526 [doi]
LID - 878526
AB  - Aim: The present study aimed to explore the potential herb-drug interactions 
      (HDI) between Shengmai injection (SMI) and losartan potassium (LOS) based on the 
      expression profiles of cytochromes P450 (CYP450) and drug transporters in rat and 
      in vitro. Methods: Different concentrations of SMI were used to explore the 
      influence of SMI on the antihypertensive efficacy of LOS in the hypertension rat 
      model established by N (omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 
      4 weeks. Subsequently, the serum concentration levels of LOS and losartan 
      carboxylic acid (EXP3174) were determined by Liquid Chromatography Mass 
      Spectrometry (LC-MS) and pharmacokinetic analysis. Human liver microsomes, human 
      multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1/P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein 
      (BCRP) vesicles, human embryonic kidney 293 cell line with stable expression of 
      the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (HEK293-OATP1B1 cells) and 
      mock-transfected HEK293 (HEK293-MOCK) cells were used to verify the effects of 
      SMI on CYP450 enzymes and drug transporters in vitro. Results: Low, medium, and 
      high concentrations of SMI increased the antihypertensive efficacy of LOS to 
      varying degrees. The high dose SMI increased the half-life (t (1/2) ), the 
      maximum plasma concentration (C (max)), the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last measurable 
      plasma concentration (AUC (0-t) ), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC (0-∞) ), 
      and mean residence time (MRT) values of LOS and decreased its apparent volume of 
      distribution (Vd) and clearance (CL) values. The AUC (0-t) , AUC (0-∞) , and MRT 
      of LOS were increased, whereas the CL was decreased by the medium concentration 
      of SMI. In addition, the high, medium, and low doses of SMI increased the 
      relative bioavailability (Frel) of LOS. SMI exhibited no significant effects on 
      the pharmacokinetics of EXP3174. In vitro, SMI exhibited different suppressive 
      effects on the enzyme activity levels of CYP1A2 (6.12%), CYP2B6 (2.72%), CYP2C9 
      (14.31%), CYP2C19 (12.96%), CYP2D6 (12.26%), CYP3A4 (3.72%), CYP2C8 
      (10.00-30.00%), MDR1 (0.75%), OATP1B1(2.03%), and BCRP (0.15%). Conclusion: In 
      conclusion, SMI improved the antihypertensive efficacy of LOS in the 
      L-NAME-induced hypertension rat model by increasing the concentration of LOS, 
      while leaving the concentration of EXP3174 intact. SMI affected the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of LOS by decreasing the elimination of LOS. These 
      effects might partly be attributed to the inhibition of the activities of CYP3A4, 
      CYP2C9, and of the drug transporters (P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1) by SMI, which need 
      further scrutiny.

      Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Between Young and Elderly Patients.
PG  - 239-243
LID - 10.1007/s40292-022-00505-w [doi]
AB  - Adequate controlled blood pressure decreases the risk of cardiovascular events. 
      However, the elderly are more vulnerable and thereby more prone to side effects 
      of antihypertensive drugs. A lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
      studies in older patients makes specific and tailored advices towards 
      antihypertensive drug therapy difficult. The aim of our study, DiffErenCes In 
      antihypertenSive drug levels In patients with hypertensiON (DECISION), is to fill 
      in this PK/PD knowledge gap and move towards precision dosing. DECISION is a 
      prospective observational PK/PD study set up to determine the difference in 
      exposure to the antihypertensive drugs, losartan and perindopril, measured by 
      drug levels in blood. The area under the curve (AUC; PK) and furthermore the 
      association between the AUC and the effect on blood pressure (PD) will be 
      compared between elderly and younger patients.

TI  - Candesartan cilexetil: an angiotensin II receptor blocker.
PG  - 1287-98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and critique the medical literature on candesartan 
      cilexetil, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE 
      searches (January 1966-January 1999) and manufacturer prescribing literature were 
      used to identify articles on candesartan cilexetil. Bibliographies were also 
      reviewed for germane articles. STUDY SELECTION: Study and review articles 
      describing the chemistry, human pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, 
      placebo-controlled trials, comparative trials, and clinical application of 
      candesartan cilexetil based on the published literature and premarketing clinical 
      trials were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: All literature on the use of candesartan 
      cilexetil for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure were included. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: ARBs are a new class of drugs with increasing use in treating 
      hypertension. Studies are ongoing to determine the role of these agents in 
      preventing remodeling after myocardial infarction and in patients with congestive 
      heart failure. Candesartan cilexetil is among the newest drugs in the class that 
      includes losartan, irbesartan, and valsartan. Candesartan cilexetil has more than 
      1000 times more affinity for the angiotensin II, type AT1 receptor ARBs, and the 
      binding affinity and competitive angiotensin II receptor antagonism is stronger 
      than that of losartan. Clinical studies in patients with hypertension have 
      demonstrated that candesartan cilexetil, in doses of 4-16 mg, is more effective 
      in reducing sitting diastolic blood pressure than are placebo and losartan 50 mg. 
      Candesartan cilexetil has demonstrated reductions in blood pressure comparable to 
      those of enalapril, with the rate of adverse events greater in the enalapril 
      group. Dosage adjustments are not necessary in elderly patients or in patients 
      with mild hepatic or renal dysfunction. In diabetic patients, blood glucose, 
      hemoglobinA1c, and serum lipids are not affected. The clinical studies 
      demonstrated that the adverse effect profile of candesartan cilexetil was similar 
      to that of placebo and there were no dose-dependent adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Candesartan cilexetil provides an alternative antihypertensive therapy that is 
      well tolerated and effective in reducing blood pressure in a wide range of 
      patients. Due to its greater binding affinity to the angiotensin II receptor, 
      candesartan cilexetil appears to have a longer antihypertensive effect than 
      losartan. This may be advantageous in decreasing morbidity and mortality 
      associated with hypertension, although further studies are required to validate 
      this potential advantage.

AB  - DMP 811 exhibited high binding affinity for the angiotensin II subtype receptor 
      AT1 in rat adrenal tissues with an IC50 of 6 nM, but not for the subtype receptor 
      AT2. In the isolated rabbit aorta, DMP 811 inhibited the contractile response to 
      angiotensin II selectively and noncompetitively with a KB value of 0.1 nM. In 
      conscious renal hypertensive rats, DMP 811 decreased blood pressure with i.v. and 
      p.o. ED30s of 0.005 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively (p.o. ED30 for losartan = 0.59 
      mg/kg). In conscious furosemide-treated dogs, DMP 811 given either at 0.3 or 1 
      mg/kg p.o. decreased blood pressure. DMP 811 has oral bioavailabilities of 7 and 
      29% in rats and dogs, respectively, after a solution dose and 8 and 13%, 
      respectively, after a suspension or capsule dosing. Our study indicates that DMP 
      811 is a selective and insurmountable AT1 receptor antagonist and is a 20-fold 
      more potent orally-active antihypertensive agent than losartan.

AB  - Polypill is a fixed-dose combination that contains three or more active 
      ingredients used as a single daily pill to achieve a large effect in preventing 
      cardiovascular disease with minimal adverse effects. A novel and accurate liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method using electrospray ionization mode 
      has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of amlodipine 
      (AMD), valsartan (VAL) using losartan (LOS) as an internal standard (IS), and 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) using furosemide (FSD) as an IS. The separation was 
      carried on Aquasil C(18) (50 mm×2.1 mm, 5 µm) reversed phase column using 
      acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid (50:50, v/v) as the mobile 
      phase. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy and precision 
      over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng/mL. The intra and inter-day precision 
      and accuracy, stability and extraction recoveries of all the analytes were in the 
      acceptable range. This method can be successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic 
      study of AMD, VAL and HCT when given as a polypill.

TI  - Fifteen years of losartan: what have we learned about losartan that can benefit 
      chronic kidney disease patients?
PG  - 93-8
AB  - Losartan, the first AT1 receptor blocker (ARB), was FDA approved 15 years ago. 
      During those years, researchers and clinicians have developed a growing base of 
      knowledge on the benefits of losartan, particularly for hypertension and renal 
      disease. These benefits include decreasing proteinuria, slowing the progression 
      of diabetic nephropathy, controlling hypertension, and decreasing stroke risk in 
      patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Although many of the benefits of 
      losartan represent a class effect for ARBs, losartan has pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic characteristics and effects that are unique and are not a class 
      effect. For example, a shorter duration of action is seen with this first ARB 
      compared with other more recently approved ARBs. Losartan also has a uricosuric 
      effect not seen in other ARBs and attenuates platelet aggregation, which is not 
      seen or is seen to a lesser extent with the other ARBs. This review presents the 
      physiological effects of losartan on the kidney and discusses relevant clinical 
      outcomes.

TI  - Upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in heart failure due to volume 
      overload.
PG  - H151-9
AB  - To examine the mechanisms of changes in beta-adrenergic signal transduction in 
      heart failing due to volume overload, we studied the status of beta-adrenoceptors 
      (beta-ARs), G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), and beta-arrestin in heart 
      failure due to aortocaval shunt (AVS). Heart failure in rats was induced by 
      creating AVS for 16 wk, and beta-AR binding, GRK activity, as well as their 
      protein content, and mRNA levels were determined in both left and right 
      ventricles. The density and protein content for beta1-ARs, unlike those for 
      beta2-ARs, were increased in the failing hearts. Furthermore, protein contents 
      for GRK isoforms and beta-arrestin-1 were decreased in membranous fractions and 
      increased in cytosolic fractions from the failing hearts. On the other hand, 
      steady-state mRNA levels for beta1-ARs and GRK2, as well as protein content for 
      Gbetagamma-subunits, did not change in the failing heart. Basal cardiac function 
      was depressed; however, both in vivo and ex vivo positive inotropic responses of 
      the failing hearts to isoproterenol were augmented. Treatment of AVS animals with 
      imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or losartan (20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) retarded the 
      progression of heart failure; partially prevented changes in beta1-ARs, GRKs, and 
      beta-arrestin-1 in the failing myocardium; and attenuated the increase in 
      positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol. These results indicate that 
      upregulation of beta1-ARs is associated with subcellular redistribution of GRKs 
      and beta-arrestin-1 in the failing heart due to volume overload. Furthermore, 
      attenuation of alterations in beta-adrenergic system by imidapril or losartan may 
      be due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in the AVS model of heart 
      failure.

      ANG-(1-7) at 10(-6) M reduced it. The effects of A779, losartan, and S3226 on the 
      J[Formula: see text] were similar to those found in WKY rats, which indicated 
      that in SHR, the ANG-(1-7) action on the NHE3 was via Mas and ANG II type 1. The 
      cytosolic calcium in the WKY or SHR rats was ~100 nM and was increased by 
      ANG-(1-7) at 10(-9) or 10(-6) M. In hypertensive animals, a high plasma level of 
      ANG-(1-7) inhibited NHE3 in the proximal tubule, which mitigated the hypertension 
      caused by the high plasma level of ANG II.

PG  - 263-4
AB  - Drug induced modification of the renin-angiotensin system is of established 
      benefit in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The responses to the 
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (CAS 75847-73-3) have 
      been studied in essential hypertension and normotensive controls. The kinetics 
      and dynamics of enalapril have been characterised in an integrated 
      concentration-effect model to identify factors underlying responsiveness to the 
      ACE inhibitor. In addition models to predict the response to long-term treatment 
      from changes after the first dose have been developed. Enalapril response could 
      be described by a non linear (Emax) model defined by two parameters - the maximum 
      response (Emax) and the drug concentration required to cause 50% of the maximum 
      response (C50). Acute dosing accurately predicted the Emax after 6 weeks 
      treatment. In addition to individual pharmacokinetics, pretreatment blood 
      pressure was the most important determinant of response to enalapril. In 
      caucasian salt-replete essential hypertension neither age nor plasma renin 
      activity were major factors. However, in states of sodium restriction and/or 
      diuretic treatment, the response to enalapril was greatly increased. The 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan has been reported to be without 
      effect on blood pressure in salt-replete normals. Salt restriction together with 
      furosemide for 3 days led to dose-related falls in blood pressure in normal 
      subjects after losartan 25-100 mg. Concentration-effect analysis can be used to 
      describe blood pressure responses, to predict the responses to long-term 
      treatment and also to identify quantitatively important factors determining the 
      response in individual patients.

PG  - 647-54
LID - 10.1007/s00109-008-0329-z [doi]
AB  - Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. 
      Molecular modeling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led 
      to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors such as aliskiren. 
      Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (2.6% to 5%) compensated by its high potency 
      to inhibit renin and a long plasma half-life (24 to 40 h), which makes it 
      suitable for once-daily dosing. The once-daily administration of aliskiren to 
      hypertensive patients lowers blood pressure as strongly as standard doses of 
      established AT1 receptor blockers (losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan), 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ramipril and lisnopril), 
      hydrochlorothiazide, or long-acting calcium channel blockers (amlodipine). In 
      combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood pressure when combined 
      with either hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, valsartan, irbesartan, or ramipril. 
      However, the biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of 
      angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism, 
      particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the 
      bradykinin-NO-cGMP pathway. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with 
      angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers, or a 
      combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic 
      approaches in medicine. However, it remains unclear how to optimize 
      renin-angiotensin system blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal benefits. 
      In this context, renin inhibition to render the renin-angiotensin system fully 
      quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study. Preliminary results show 
      that short-term administration of aliskiren has beneficial anti-albuminuric 
      effects in diabetic patients with chronic nephropathy and favorable neurohormonal 
      effects in patients with chronic heart failure.

TI  - Pharmacology of AT1-receptor blockers.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - Angiotensin II mediates its haemodynamic effects by binding to specific 
      cell-surface receptors. In humans, two receptor subtypes have been identified, 
      designated AT1 and AT2. Because all major deleterious effects of angiotensin II 
      are produced via binding to AT1-receptors, selective blockade of this receptor 
      subtype should confer haemodynamic benefits, while allowing stimulation of the 
      potentially beneficial effects mediated by AT2-receptors. Experimental studies 
      using various models have consistently revealed marked differences in the 
      receptor binding properties of different AT1-receptor blockers. The relative 
      receptor binding affinities of currently available AT1-receptor blockers is 
      candesartan > irbesartan > valsartan/EXP-3174/telmisartan > tasosartan > losartan 
      > eprosartan. Candesartan is also released from the receptor more slowly than 
      other available AT1-receptor blockers, with a half-life of approximately 152 min 
      for the receptor-blocker complex, compared with 31 min for EXP-3 174, 17 min for 
      irbesartan and 5 min for losartan. Candesartan therefore binds to the 
      AT1-receptor more tightly and more persistently than other AT1-receptor blockers.

TI  - Differences in CYP2C9 Genotype and Enzyme Activity Between Swedes and Koreans of 
      Relevance for Personalized Medicine: Role of Ethnicity, Genotype, Smoking, Age, 
      and Sex.
PG  - 346-53
LID - 10.1089/omi.2015.0022 [doi]
AB  - Global personalized medicine demands the characterization of person-to-person and 
      between-population differences in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
      CYP2C9 pharmacokinetic pathway is subject to modulation by both genetic and 
      environmental factors. CYP2C9 genotype-based dose recommendations (e.g., for 
      warfarin) is advocated. However, the overall contribution of genotype for 
      variation in enzyme activity may differ between populations. We evaluated the 
      importance of ethnicity, genotype, smoking, body weight, age, and sex for CYP2C9 
      enzyme activity. CYP2C9 genotype and phenotype was determined in 148 Swedes and 
      146 Koreans using losartan as a probe. CYP2C9 enzyme activity was assessed using 
      urinary losartan/metabolite E-3174 ratio. The frequency of CYP2C9 defective 
      variant alleles (*2 and *3) was significantly higher in Swedes (10.8% and 12.5%) 
      than in Koreans (0% and 5.8%). In matched genotypes, CYP2C9 enzyme activity was 
      significantly lower in Swedes compared to Koreans (p<0.0001). In a univariate 
      analysis, age, weight, ethnicity, genotype, and smoking were significant 
      predictors of CYP2C9 phenotype. A stepwise multivariate analysis indicated 
      ethnicity, genotype, and smoking remained as significant predictors of CYP2C9 
      enzyme activity, accounting for 50% of the total variance. In both study 
      populations, CYP2C9 genotype was a significant predictor of CYP2C9 enzyme 
      activity, but its contribution in explaining the total variance was lower in 
      Koreans (26.6%) than Swedes (40%). In conclusion, we report significantly lower 
      CYP2C9 enzyme activity in Swedes compared to Koreans, partly but not exclusively 
      due to CYP2C9 pharmacogenetic variations. Ethnicity and environment factors need 
      to be considered together with genotype for population-specific dose optimization 
      and global personalized medicine.

TI  - Human bioequivalence evaluation of two losartan potassium tablets under fasting 
      conditions.
PG  - 190-5
AB  - The bioequivalence of two different tablet formulations containing losartan 
      potassium 100 mg was determined in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose in 
      a randomized crossover study. Test and reference products were administered to 60 
      volunteers with 240 ml water after overnight fasting. Plasma concentrations of 
      losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite were monitored over a period 
      of 36 h after drug administration by validated LC/MS/MS analytical method. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC0-t/AUC0-∞, tmax, Kel and t½ 
      were determined from plasma concentration time profile of both formulations for 
      losartan and its active metabolite losartan carboxylic acid and were found to be 
      in good agreement. The carboxylic acid metabolite was considered for profiling 
      purpose only. The analysis of variance did not show any significant difference 
      between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of Cmax 
      (84.89-104.09%), AUC0-t (95.84-102.84%) and AUC0-∞ (96.43-103.25%) values for 
      losartan between the test and reference products were within the 80-125% 
      interval, satisfying the bioequivalence criteria of the US FDA guidelines. These 
      results indicate that the test and the reference products of losartan potassium 
      are bioequivalent and, thus, may be prescribed interchangeably.

TI  - Interaction of angiotensin II type 1 and D5 dopamine receptors in renal proximal 
      tubule cells.
PG  - 804-10
AB  - Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor and D1 and D3 dopamine receptors directly 
      interact in renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats 
      (WKY). There is indirect evidence for a D5 and AT1 receptor interaction in WKY 
      and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Therefore, we sought direct evidence 
      of an interaction between AT1 and D5 receptors in RPT cells. D5 and AT1 receptors 
      colocalized in WKY cells. Angiotensin II decreased D5 receptors in WKY cells in a 
      time- and concentration-dependent manner (EC50=2.7x10(-9) M; t(1/2)=4.9 hours), 
      effects that were blocked by an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan). In SHR, 
      angiotensin II (10(-8) M/24 hours) also decreased D5 receptors (0.96+/-0.08 
      versus 0.72+/-0.08; n=12) and to the same degree as in WKY cells (1.44+/-0.07 
      versus 0.92+/-0.08). However, basal D5 receptors were decreased in SHR RPT cells 
      (SHR 0.96+/-0.08; WKY 1.44+/-0.07; n=12 per strain; P<0.05) and renal brush 
      border membranes of SHR compared with WKY (SHR 0.54+/-0.16 versus WKY 
      1.46+/-0.10; n=5 per strain; P<0.05). Angiotensin II decreased AT1 receptor 
      expression in WKY (1.00+/-0.04 versus 0.72+/-0.08; n=8; P<0.05) but increased it 
      in SHR (0.96+/-0.04 versus 1.32+/-0.08; n=8; P<0.05). AT(1) and D5 receptors also 
      interacted in vivo; renal D5 receptor protein was higher in mice lacking the AT1A 
      receptor (AT1A-/-; 1.61+/-0.31; n=6) than in wild-type littermates used as 
      controls (AT1A+/+; 0.81+/-0.08; n=6; P<0.05), and renal cortical AT1 receptor 
      protein was higher in D5 receptor null mice than in wild-type littermates 
      (1.18+/-0.08 versus 0.84+/-0.07; n=4; P<0.05). We conclude that D5 and AT1 
      receptors interact with each other. Altered interactions between AT1 and dopamine 
      receptors may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

TI  - Losartan in cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 433-46
LID - 10.2217/14796678.1.4.433 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular 
      disease. Numerous placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that treatment of 
      hypertension results in substantial reduction of hypertension-related vascular 
      events. The benefit of specific therapies beyond their effect on blood pressure 
      is well established. Losartan is an orally-active, selective, nonpeptide, 
      angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonist (ARB), and it was the first in this 
      class to be marketed. Several large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that 
      losartan and other ARBs have benefits in preventing cardiovascular disease. The 
      Losartan Intervention For End point reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study 
      demonstrated improved outcomes with losartan as compared with atenolol-based 
      therapies in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, mainly 
      because of stroke prevention. The Reduction of End points in 
      Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist 
      Losartan (RENAAL) study demonstrated that losartan prevented the progression of 
      diabetic nephropathy. In this review, evidence from these and other clinical 
      trials with losartan shall be discussed. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
      properties of losartan are described to explain its mechanisms of action. Among 
      the ARB class, losartan possesses certain unique properties, which may enhance 
      its cardiovascular protective effects. These include an increase of urinary uric 
      acid excretion and antiatherothrombotic properties. Potential future roles for 
      losartan and other ARBs shall be discussed, in addition to emphasizing areas in 
      which evidence is currently lacking or indecisive, including head-to-head 
      comparisons of ARBs and the effects of combining an ARB with 
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.

TI  - Design and Evaluation of Losartan Potassium Effervescent Floating Matrix Tablets: 
      In Vivo X-ray Imaging and Pharmacokinetic Studies in Albino Rabbits.
LID - 10.3390/polym13203476 [doi]
LID - 3476
AB  - Losartan potassium (LP) is an angiotensin receptor blocker used to treat 
      hypertension. At higher pH, it shows poor aqueous solubility, which leads to poor 
      bioavailability and lowers its therapeutic effectiveness. The main aim of this 
      research was to develop a direct compressed effervescent floating matrix tablet 
      (EFMT) of LP using hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose 90SH 15,000 (HPMC-90SH 
      15,000), karaya gum (KG), and an effervescent agent, such as sodium bicarbonate 
      (SB). Therefore, an EFMT has been developed to prolong the stomach residence time 
      (GRT) of a drug to several hours and improve its bioavailability in the stomach 
      region. The blended powder was evaluated for pre-compression characteristics, 
      followed by post-compression characteristics, in vitro floating, water uptake 
      studies, and in vitro studies. The optimized formulation of EFMT was investigated 
      for in vivo buoyancy by X-ray imaging and pharmacokinetic studies in Albino 
      rabbits. The results revealed that the parameters of pre- and post-compression 
      were within the USP limits. All tablets showed good floating capabilities (short 
      floating lag time <1 min and floated for >24 h), good swelling characteristics, 
      and controlled release for over 24 h. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and 
      differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectra showed drug-polymer 
      compatibility. The optimized formulation F3 (HPMC-90SH 15,000-KG) exhibited 
      non-Fickian diffusion and showed 100% drug release at the end of 24 h. In 
      addition, with the optimized formulation F3, we observed that the EFMT floated 
      continuously in the rabbit's stomach area; thus, the GRT could be extended to 
      more than 12 h. The pharmacokinetic profiling in Albino rabbits revealed that the 
      relative bioavailability of the optimized LP-EFMT was enhanced compared to an 
      oral solution of LP. We conclude that this a potential method for improving the 
      oral bioavailability of LP to treat hypertension effectively.

TI  - Sympathetic tone assessed by washout of iodine 125-labeled 
      metaiodobenzylguanidine from the murine left ventricle--influence of 
      immobilization stress and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
PG  - 507-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because it is not metabolized as is norepinephrine (NE), most of the 
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) taken up by the heart is considered to be lost 
      subsequently by release concomitant with sympathetic stimulation. Therefore we 
      examined whether the washout of MIBG is influenced by sympathetic tone, which we 
      modulated by using immobilization stress or activation of the renin-angiotensin 
      system (RAS). METHODS AND RESULTS: In 175 male ddY mice, left ventricular 
      radioactivity was counted 30 minutes or 4 hours after injection of 74 kBq (2 
      microCi) of iodine 125- or iodine 131-labeled MIBG (125I- or 131I-MIBG). The 
      washout rates of MIBG were determined under immobilization stress or under sodium 
      loading or restriction in combination with losartan (10 mg/kg) or cilazapril (1 
      mg/kg) pretreatment. Immobilization enhanced the washout of 125I-MIBG (80.9% vs 
      57.9% in the control animals); this was determined to be related to washout from 
      the neuronal compartment, because the nonneuronal component assessed through 
      desipramine pretreatment was not affected. Pretreatment with losartan or 
      cilazapril decreased the facilitation of 125I-MIBG washout in sodium-restricted 
      mice (40.9% and 33.7%, respectively, vs 43.5% in the control animals), but not in 
      sodium-loaded mice. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of MIBG washout may be feasible for 
      determining the changes in sympathetic tone caused by immobilization stress or 
      activation of the RAS.

TI  - Effects of SCH27899 (Ziracin), an oligosaccharide everninomicin antibiotic, on 
      urate kinetics in humans.
PG  - 255-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intravenous administration of an everninomicin antibiotic, SCH27899 
      (Ziracin), in healthy subjects caused a marked decrease in serum urate by 
      increasing its urinary excretion, as well as an increase in serum bilirubin in a 
      dose-dependent manner. To clarify the underlying mechanism, a crossover study and 
      an in vitro study were conducted. METHODS: Crossover study was performed in nine 
      healthy male volunteers over three periods by administering SCH27899 (1-h i.v. 
      infusion of 3 mg/kg) alone, probenecid (2000 mg, p.o.) alone and their 
      combination. Also, an in vitro experiment was conducted using rat brush-border 
      membrane vesicles to elucidate the effect of SCH27899 on urate transport across 
      renal tubular epithelium. RESULTS: SCH27899 alone and probenecid alone showed a 
      uricosuric, serum urate-lowering effect, and, when given in combination, the 
      effects on serum urate appeared to be additive, as indicated in the earlier 
      phase, prior to the peaks of respective drug effects. Serum and urinary 
      concentrations of SCH27899 were not influenced by the co-administration of 
      probenecid. Serum bilirubin was also significantly increased by both SCH27899 
      alone and in combination with probenecid. The SCH27899-probenecid combination 
      additive effect on serum bilirubin did not reach significance. SCH27899, 
      probenecid and losartan, an angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist possessing a 
      uricosuric effect, significantly inhibited (14)C-urate uptake into the vesicles, 
      which was dependent on the pH gradient across the membrane; whereas, vancomycin 
      did not. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that SCH27899 itself contributes, at least 
      in part, to a uricosuric effect following i.v. infusion. However, some 
      metabolite(s) may also contribute to this, since the degree of urate-uptake 
      inhibition by SCH27899 was less than probenecid and losartan, and the serum 
      urate-lowering effect was delayed and prolonged compared with the time profile of 
      serum concentration.

TI  - Effects of Xuesaitong on the Pharmacokinetics of Losartan: An In Vivo UPLC-MS/MS 
      Study.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether Xuesaitong, a multiherbal 
      formulation for coronary heart disease, alters the pharmacokinetics of losartan. 
      Adult male Sprague Dawley rats randomly received losartan (10 mg/kg) or losartan 
      plus Xuesaitong (10 mg/kg) through an oral gavage (n = 6). Multiple blood samples 
      were obtained for up to 36 h to determine the concentrations of losartan and its 
      active metabolite, EXP3174, through ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Pharmacokinetics were estimated using a 
      noncompartmental model. The half-life (t (1/2)) of losartan was decreased by 
      Xuesaitong (4.26 ± 1.51 vs. 6.35 ± 2.10 h; P < 0.05). The apparent volume of 
      distribution (V (d)) of losartan was also decreased by the combination of 
      losartan and Xuesaitong (4.41 ± 1.61 vs. 7.20 ± 2.41 mL; P < 0.05). The time to 
      maximum concentration (T (max)) of losartan was increased by Xuesaitong 
      (1.06 ± 1.04 vs. 0.13 ± 0.05 h; P < 0.05). Xuesaitong also decreased the t (1/2) 
      of EXP3174 (8.22 ± 1.41 vs. 6.29 ± 1.38 h; P < 0.05). These results suggest that 
      there is a complex interaction between losartan and Xuesaitong. In addition to 
      enhanced elimination of losartan and EXP3174, Xuesaitong may also decrease the 
      absorption rate and V (d) of losartan.

TI  - Renin inhibition with aliskiren.
PG  - 426-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04890.x [doi]
AB  - 1. Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. 
      Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have 
      led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren. 
      2. Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (between 2.6 and 5.0%) compensated by its 
      high potency to inhibit renin (IC50: 0.6 nmol/L) and a long plasma half-life 
      (23-36 h), which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. 3. The once-daily 
      administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as 
      standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers 
      (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan), hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin converting 
      enzyme inhibitors (ramipril and lisinopril) or long acting calcium channel 
      blockers (amlodipine). In combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood 
      pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan or 
      ramipril. 4. The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those 
      of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and Ang II antagonism, 
      particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the 
      bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the 
      (pro)renin receptor. 5. Blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE 
      inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one 
      of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. However, it remains 
      unclear how to optimize RAS blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal 
      benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the RAS fully quiescent is 
      a new possibility requiring further study.

TI  - [Use of angiotensin II receptor blockaders in heart failure].
PG  - 817-21
AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics represent the first 
      line of therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Inhibition of 
      angiotensin II production is, however, incomplete with ACE inhibitors, due to 
      non-ACE dependent conversion pathways. Moreover, some patients are intolerant to 
      ACE inhibitors due to side effects or renal insufficiency. Angiotensin II 
      receptor blockers may be an alternative to, or an additional treatment in heart 
      failure. Preliminary studies comparing the angiotensin II receptor blocker 
      losartan with placebo have demonstrated improved haemodynamic parameters, reduced 
      hospitalisation and mortality in patients with heart failure. Reduced morbidity 
      and mortality have also been found with losartan treatment, as compared to the 
      ACE inhibitor captopril. This paper discusses the role of angiotensin II receptor 
      blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Some results from published studies 
      and a short description of ongoing trials are presented.

AB  - Therapeutics Letter 13 reviews four newer drugs: losartan, lansoprazole, 
      cefprozil, zuclopenthixol. Conclusions: Losartan, starting with a dose of 12.5 mg 
      once daily, may be considered in patients who require an ACE inhibitor. 
      Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor which is similar to omeprazole in 
      potency, pharmacokinetics, safety and effectiveness. Cefprozil is a new oral 
      cephalosporin, which should be reserved for patients who are allergic or 
      intolerant to the first or second line choices. Zuclopenthixol is a thioxanthene 
      neuroleptic similar to flupenthixol. It has no distinctive advantages over 
      haloperidol and other neuroleptics and should be reserved for selected patients 
      who fail to respond or are intolerant to other neuroleptics.

AB  - Theoretical considerations and experimental data suggest that AT1-antagonists can 
      offer the same advantages as ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of hypertensive 
      patients without causing side effects such as angioedema and cough. The 
      pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs suggest that AT1-antagonists can be 
      given once-daily. Preliminary data obtained with losartan indicate that this 
      drug, given once daily, significantly reduced blood pressure with a favourable 
      trough to peak ratio. Moreover the hypotensive effect of this drug was similar to 
      that exerted by other hypotensive drugs currently employed in the treatment of 
      hypertensive patients. Losartan can be usefully combined with a thiazide diuretic 
      inducing an additive antihypertensive effect. No negative effect on lipid and 
      glucose profiles was recorded. Furthermore, losartan exerted an uricosuric 
      action, thus reducing serum uric acid. Preliminary data suggest that the 
      incidence of cough in patients treated with losartan was similar to that observed 
      in patients receiving placebo or a thiazide diuretic. Although these data need to 
      be confirmed by ongoing and future studies, it is tempting to hypothesize that 
      this new class of antihypertensive drugs can offer a further useful tool in the 
      treatment of hypertensive patients.

TI  - ANG III induces expression of inducible transcription factors of AP-1 and Krox 
      families in rat brain.
PG  - R845-50
AB  - In addition to rapid responses comprising increases in blood pressure, drinking, 
      and stimulation of natriuresis, ANG II induces the expression of transcription 
      factors (TF) in the central nervous system. The ANG II metabolite ANG III (ANG 
      2-8) has been demonstrated to exert physiological effects similar to those of ANG 
      II. We aimed to determine 1) whether ANG III induces TF expression in the brain, 
      2) which ANG II (AT) receptor subtype is involved, and 3) whether the two 
      peptides, ANG II and ANG III, differ in their efficacy to stimulate TF 
      expression. ANG II (100 pmol), ANG III (100 pmol), or vehicle was injected into 
      the lateral brain ventricle of conscious rats alone or in combination with the 
      AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan (10 nmol), the AT(2) receptor antagonist 
      PD-123319 (5 nmol), or the aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin (10 nmol). Similar 
      to ANG II, ANG III induced the expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and Krox-24 in four 
      brain regions, subfornical organ, median preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, 
      and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, with the same efficacy. This effect 
      was AT(1) receptor mediated. Pretreatment with amastatin reduced the expression 
      of TF in response to ANG II, indicating that this expression is partly mediated 
      by ANG III. Interestingly, the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123319 alone slightly 
      enhanced the expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and Krox-24 in different populations of 
      neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. These data indicate that different 
      populations of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are tonically inhibited by 
      AT(2) receptors under physiological conditions.

PG  - 1015-22
LID - 10.1007/s40265-016-0592-1 [doi]
AB  - Fimasartan is the ninth, and most recent, angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      approved as an antihypertensive agent. Fimasartan, a pyrimidin-4(3H)-one 
      derivative of losartan with the imidazole ring replaced, which enables higher 
      potency and longer duration than losartan. Fecal elimination and biliary 
      excretion are the predominant elimination pathways of fimasartan and the urinary 
      excretion was found to be less than 3 % 24 h after administration. Fimasartan is 
      primarily catabolized by cytochrome P450 isoform 3A and no significant drug 
      interaction was observed when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, 
      amlodipine, warfarin, or digoxin. Fimasartan at a dosage range of 60-120 mg once 
      daily showed an antihypertensive effect over 24 h. In a large, population-based 
      observational study, fimasartan showed an excellent safety profile. 
      Anti-inflammatory and organ-protecting effects of fimasartan have been shown in 
      various preclinical studies, including aortic balloon injury, myocardial infarct 
      ischemia/reperfusion, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, and ischemic stroke models.

TI  - Angiotensin II mediates urotensin II expression by hypoxia in cultured cardiac 
      fibroblast.
PG  - 17-26
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2011.02549.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urotensin II plays a role in myocardial remodelling. Cardiac 
      fibroblasts play a critical role in the development of cardiac fibrosis. The 
      effect of hypoxia on urotensin II expression in cardiac fibroblasts is poorly 
      understood. We sought to investigate the regulation of urotensin II by hypoxia in 
      cardiac fibroblasts and the effect of angiotensin II in the interaction with 
      urotensin II. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rat cardiac fibroblasts were cultured in 
      hypoxic chamber. Hypoxia significantly increased urotensin II expression and 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. 
      Hypoxia-induced increase in urotensin II protein and ROS was significantly 
      attenuated after the addition of SP600125, JNK siRNA or N-acetylcysteine before 
      hypoxia treatment. The phosphorylated JNK protein was induced by hypoxia and was 
      abolished by pretreatment with SP600125, losartan (an angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist) or N-acetylcysteine. The increased urotensin II expression by 
      exogenous addition of angiotensin II was similar to that by hypoxia. Addition of 
      losartan and angiotensin II antibody before hypoxia almost completely inhibited 
      the increase in urotensin II induced by hypoxia. Hypoxia significantly increased 
      the secretion of angiotensin II from cardiac fibroblasts and increased the 
      collagen I protein expression. Hypoxia significantly increased the urotensin II 
      promoter activity by 4·3-fold as compared to normoxic control. Urotensin II siRNA 
      almost completely attenuated the collagen I protein expression induced by 
      hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia-induced urotensin II expression in cardiac 
      fibroblast is mediated by angiotensin II and through ROS and JNK pathway. 
      Urotensin II is a mediator of angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis under 
      hypoxia.

TI  - Olmesartan medoxomil: a review of its use in the management of hypertension.
PG  - 1239-72
AB  - Olmesartan medoxomil (Olmetec, Benicar) is an angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) 
      receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) that inhibits the 
      actions of angiotensin II on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which 
      plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Oral olmesartan medoxomil 
      10-40 mg once daily is recommended for the treatment of adult patients with 
      hypertension. In those with inadequate BP control using monotherapy, fixed-dose 
      olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) [Olmetec plus, Benicar-HCT] 
      combination therapy may be initiated. Extensive clinical evidence from several 
      large well designed trials and the clinical practice setting has confirmed the 
      antihypertensive efficacy and good tolerability profile of oral olmesartan 
      medoxomil, as monotherapy or in combination with HCTZ, in patients with 
      hypertension, including elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension 
      (ISH). Notably, BP control is sustained throughout the 24-hour dosage interval, 
      including during the last 4 hours of this period. In clinical trials, olmesartan 
      medoxomil monotherapy provided better antihypertensive efficacy than losartan, 
      candesartan cilexetil or irbesartan monotherapy, and was at least as effective as 
      valsartan treatment, with a faster onset of action than other ARBs in terms of 
      reductions from baseline in diastolic BP (DBP) and, in most instances, systolic 
      BP (SBP). Combination therapy with olmesartan medoxomil plus HCTZ was superior to 
      that with benazepril plus amlodipine, as effective as that with losartan plus 
      HCTZ, noninferior to that with atenolol plus HCTZ, but less effective than that 
      with telmisartan plus HCTZ, in individual trials. Data from ongoing clinical 
      outcome trials are required to more fully determine the relative position of 
      olmesartan medoxomil therapy in the management of hypertension. In the meantime, 
      the consistent antihypertensive efficacy during the entire 24-hour dosage 
      interval and good tolerability profile of olmesartan medoxomil, with or without 
      HCTZ, make it a valuable option for the treatment of adult patients with 
      hypertension, including the elderly.

TI  - Perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day: a review of its place in the management of 
      hypertension.
PG  - 1211-29
AB  - The fixed low-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the 
      non-thiazide diuretic indapamide has been evaluated in the management of patients 
      with mild to moderate hypertension. Combination therapy aims to improve overall 
      therapeutic efficacy while minimising adverse effects. In well-designed 
      multicentre clinical trials, perindopril/indapamide at doses ranging from 2/0.625 
      to 8/2.5 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving 
      adequate blood pressure (BP) control. A similar reduction in supine BP was 
      observed when combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was compared with 
      losartan 50 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. Similar reductions in 24-hour 
      ambulatory BP were also seen with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day and 
      irbesartan 150 mg/day. However, response and normalisation rates were 
      significantly higher with combination therapy than with losartan or irbesartan 
      monotherapy. Combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day therapy effectively 
      reduced BP in elderly patients aged 65 to 85 years to a significantly greater 
      extent than either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Supine BP was also normalised 
      in approximately two-thirds of patients in a small noncomparative trial in 
      patients with hypertension and renal impairment. Low-dose perindopril/indapamide 
      2/0.625 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical trials; the most common adverse 
      events were headache and cough. Hypokalaemia, associated with the use of 
      diuretics, occurred with a higher incidence with combined perindopril/indapamide 
      2/0.625 mg/day therapy than with either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. 
      Perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day has shown efficacy in well designed 
      comparative trials with atenolol, losartan and irbesartan including elderly 
      patients and patients with renal impairment. Studies comparing this dosage of 
      perindopril/ indapamide with other combination therapies would be beneficial in 
      allowing the place of perindopril/indapamide to be more accurately determined. 
      The fixed-low dose combination of perindopril/indapamide provides a promising and 
      well tolerated treatment option in the management of patients with mild to 
      moderate hypertension.

TI  - Evaluation of potential drug interactions with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate: a 
      single-center, open-label, one sequence crossover study in healthy adults.
PG  - 1808-1816
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfaa222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) is an oral 
      potassium binder for the treatment of hyperkalemia in adults. SZC acts in the 
      gastrointestinal tract and additionally binds hydrogen ions in acidic 
      environments like the stomach, potentially transiently increasing gastric pH and 
      leading to drug interactions with pH-sensitive drugs. This study assessed 
      potential pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between SZC and nine pH-sensitive 
      drugs. METHODS: In this single-dose, open-label, single-sequence cross-over study 
      in healthy adults, amlodipine, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, dabigatran, furosemide, 
      glipizide, levothyroxine, losartan or warfarin were each administered alone and, 
      following a washout interval, with SZC 10 g. Maximum plasma concentration (C 
      (max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the last time 
      point (AUC(0-) (t) ) and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC(inf)) were evaluated. 
      No interaction was concluded if the 90% confidence interval for the geometric 
      mean ratio (SZC coadministration versus alone) of the PK parameters was within 
      80-125%. RESULTS: During SZC coadministration, all PK parameters for amlodipine, 
      glipizide, levothyroxine and losartan showed no interaction, while reductions in 
      clopidogrel and dabigatran C (max), AUC(0-) (t) and AUC(inf) (basic drugs) were 
      <50% and increases in atorvastatin, furosemide and warfarin C (max) (acidic 
      drugs) exceeded the no-interaction range by ˂2-fold. CONCLUSIONS: SZC 
      coadministration was associated with small changes in plasma concentration and 
      exposure of five of the nine drugs evaluated in this study. These PK drug 
      interactions are consistent with transient increases in gastric pH with SZC and 
      are unlikely to be clinically meaningful.

AB  - This work investigates the addition of monosaccharides to marketed drugs to 
      improve their pharmacokinetic properties for oral absorption. To this end, a set 
      of chloromethyl glycoside synthons were developed to prepare a variety of 
      glycosyloxymethyl-prodrugs derived from 5-fluorouracil, thioguanine, propofol and 
      losartan. Drug release was studied in vitro using β-glucosidase confirming rapid 
      conversion of the monosaccharide prodrugs to release the parent drug, 
      formaldehyde and the monosaccharide. To showcase this prodrug approach, a 
      glucosyloxymethyl conjugate of the tetrazole-containing drug losartan was used 
      for in vivo experiments and showed complete release of the drug in a dog-model.

PG  - 455-464
AB  - To observe the effect of Soyisoflavones (SI) on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin 
      signaling pathway elements, transforming growth factor-β (THGF-β) and its related 
      proteins in the renal interstitia of diabetic nephropathic (DN) rats, 48 DN rats 
      were randomly divided into 4 groups: DN model group (group DN), soybean 
      isoflavone treatment group (group DA), DN model group + losartan treatment group 
      (group DL), DN model group + soybean isoflavones combined with losartan treatment 
      group (group SL). Each group comprised 12 rats. Twelve healthy Wistar rats were 
      selected as normal controls (group N). After 12 weeks of continuous 
      administration of soybean isoflavone or losartan or those two combined, the body 
      weight of rats was recorded and serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Scr) 
      were measured. The expression of Wnt4, β-catenin, and TGF-β1 proteins, as well as 
      mRNA, in the renal interstitium were detected by immunohistochemistry and 
      real-time quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR). In all the groups, Wnt4, β-catenin and 
      TGF-β1 protein were only expressed in renal interstitial and renal tubular 
      epithelial cells. There was no significant difference between group DA and group 
      DL (P>0.05). FQ-PCR results showed that Wnt4, β-catenin and TGF-β1 mRNA were 
      consistent with the expression of these proteins in the renal tissue of each 
      group. Soy isoflavones can reduce 24-h urinary protein quantification, alleviate 
      renal interstitial pathological damage, and regulate the expression of Wnt4, 
      β-catenin and TGF-β1 in the renal interstitium. This suggests that soybean 
      isoflavones could delay the process of renal interstitial fibrosis in DN rats by 
      decreasing the expression of Wnt4, β-catenin and TGF-β1 in the renal 
      interstitium, thus demonstrating that soybean isoflavones plus losartan have the 
      best protective effects against diabetes-induced renal fibrosis.

      after administration of afobazole in comparison to standard inducers and 
      inhibitors of cytochromes].
PG  - 36-9
AB  - The effect of subchronic peroral administration in effective doses of afobazole 
      (5 mg/kg), and cytochrome P450 inductors (rifampicin, 13.4 mg/kg; phenytoin, 10.4 
      mg/kg) and inhibitors (fluconazole, 35.7 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin, 44.0 mg/kg) on the 
      metabolic ratio (MR) of drugs-markers of CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 activity was studied 
      in rats. Afobazole did not change the MR of compounds metabolized by the P450 
      isoforms studied. After peroral administration of standard P450 inductors and 
      inhibitors, statistically significant bidirectional effects were identified, 
      which demonstrated the expedience of administering a complex of selected 
      compounds, markers, and CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 activity modificators for comparative 
      evaluation of the effects of new drugs in rats. It is recommended to evaluate the 
      activity of CYP1A2 by determining the MR for one of two caffeine metabolites, 
      paraxanthine or theobromine, and the activity of CYP2C9 by determining the MR of 
      metabolite Exp-3174 to losartan.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.
PG  - 263-81
AB  - Fluvastatin, the first fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been 
      shown to reduce cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidaemia, to prevent 
      subsequent coronary events in patients with established coronary heart disease, 
      and to alter endothelial function and plaque stability in animal models. 
      Fluvastatin is relatively hydrophilic, compared with the semisynthetic HMG-CoA 
      reductase inhibitors, and, therefore, it is extensively absorbed from the 
      gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, it is nearly completely extracted and 
      metabolised in the liver to 2 hydroxylated metabolites and an N-desisopropyl 
      metabolite, which are excreted in the bile. Approximately 95% of a dose is 
      recovered in the faeces, with 60% of a dose recovered as the 3 metabolites. The 
      6-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl fluvastatin metabolites are exclusively generated by 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and do not accumulate in the blood. CYP2C9, CYP3A4, 
      CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 form the 5-hydroxy fluvastatin metabolite. Because of its 
      hydrophilic nature and extensive plasma protein binding, fluvastatin has a small 
      volume of distribution with minimal concentrations in extrahepatic tissues. The 
      pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin are not influenced by renal function, due to its 
      extensive metabolism and biliary excretion; limited data in patients with 
      cirrhosis suggest a 30% reduction in oral clearance. Age and gender do not appear 
      to affect the disposition of fluvastatin. CYP3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin, 
      ketoconazole and itraconazole) have no effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, in 
      contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are primarily metabolised by 
      CYP3A and are subject to potential drug interactions with CYP3A inhibitors. 
      Coadministration of fluvastatin with gastrointestinal agents such as 
      cholestyramine, and gastric acid regulating agents (H2 receptor antagonists and 
      proton pump inhibitors), significantly alters fluvastatin disposition by 
      decreasing and increasing bioavailability, respectively. The nonspecific CYP 
      inducer rifampicin (rifampin) significantly increases fluvastatin oral clearance. 
      In addition to being a CYP2C9 substrate, fluvastatin demonstrates inhibitory 
      effects on this isoenzyme in vitro and in vivo. In human liver microsomes, 
      fluvastatin significantly inhibits the hydroxylation of 2 CYP2C9 substrates, 
      tolbutamide and diclofenac. The oral clearances of the CYP2C9 substrates 
      diclofenac, tolbutamide, glibenclamide (glyburide) and losartan are reduced by 15 
      to 25% when coadministered with fluvastatin. These alterations have not been 
      shown to be clinically significant. There are inadequate data evaluating the 
      potential interaction of fluvastatin with warfarin and phenytoin, 2 CYP2C9 
      substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and caution is recommended when using 
      fluvastatin with these agents. Fluvastatin does not appear to have a significant 
      effect on other CYP isoenzymes or P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.

TI  - Maitake mushroom extracts ameliorate progressive hypertension and other chronic 
      metabolic perturbations in aging female rats.
PG  - 169-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the ability of two commercially-available fractions 
      labeled SX and D derived from the edible maitake mushroom to overcome many 
      age-associated metabolic perturbations such as progressive, age-related elevation 
      of blood pressure, over activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), decreased 
      insulin sensitivity, and inflammation in an in vivo laboratory model. DESIGN AND 
      METHOD: We divided forty mature, female Sprague-Dawley rats (SD) into five groups 
      of eight. SD ingested regular rat chow containing added sucrose (20% w/w). The 
      groups received baseline diet alone (control) or baseline diet containing 
      captopril, niacin-bound chromium, maitake fraction SX, or maitake fraction D. In 
      addition to blood pressure readings, the following procedures were implemented: 
      losartan and insulin challenges, evaluation of serum ACE activity, glucose 
      tolerance testing, blood chemistries, LNAME challenge, and measurement of various 
      circulating cytokines. RESULTS: We found that implementation of all test 
      conditions stopped the gradual elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 
      SD over the four months of study, even reversing some of the previous elevation 
      that occurred over time. In general, the treatment groups showed decreased 
      activity of the RAS estimated by less lowering of SBP after losartan challenge 
      and decreased serum ACE activity and were more sensitive to exogenous insulin 
      challenge. TNFa levels decreased in all four test groups suggesting a lessening 
      of the inflammatory state. CONCLUSIONS: We believe our data suggest that maitake 
      mushroom fractions lessen age-related hypertension, at least in part, via effects 
      on the RAS; enhance insulin sensitivity; and reduce some aspects of 
      inflammation--actions that should lead to a longer, healthier life span.

TI  - Telmisartan: a review of its use in hypertension.
PG  - 1501-29
AB  - Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that is highly selective for 
      type 1 angiotensin II receptors. It was significantly more effective than placebo 
      in large (n >100), double-blind, randomised, multicentre clinical trials in 
      patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Telmisartan 20 to 160 mg once daily 
      produced mean reductions in supine trough systolic blood pressure and diastolic 
      blood pressure of up to 15.5 and 10.5 mm Hg, respectively. Maximum blood pressure 
      reduction occurred with a dosage of 40 to 80 mg/day. Telmisartan 40 to 120 mg/day 
      was as effective as amlodipine 5 to 10 mg/day or atenolol 50 to 100 mg/day in 
      dose-titration studies. Telmisartan 20 to 160 mg/day was generally similar in 
      efficacy to enalapril 5 to 20 mg/day or lisinopril 10 to 40 mg/day in both 
      titration-to-response and other studies. Hydrochlorothiazide was coadministered 
      in most of the titration-to-response studies if patients remained hypertensive. 
      Telmisartan 80 mg/day was more effective than submaximal dosages of losartan (50 
      mg/day) or valsartan (80 mg/day) and was as effective as a fixed-dose combination 
      of losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg over the last 6 hours of the 
      dosage interval and the whole 24-hour postdose interval. In patients with severe 
      hypertension, telmisartan 80 to 160 mg/day was as effective as enalapril 20 to 40 
      mg/day (both agents could be titrated and combined sequentially with 
      hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amlodipine 5 mg). The addition of 
      hydrochlorothiazide to telmisartan was more effective than each agent alone at 
      lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Telmisartan was well 
      tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and was significantly 
      less likely to cause persistent, dry cough than lisinopril. CONCLUSION: 
      Telmisartan is an effective antihypertensive agent with a tolerability profile 
      similar to that of placebo. Comparative data have shown telmisartan to be as 
      effective as other major classes of antihypertensive agents at lowering blood 
      pressure. Compared with lisinopril, telmisartan is associated with a 
      significantly lower incidence of dry, persistent cough. Therefore, telmisartan is 
      a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension.

TI  - Low mercury concentration produces vasoconstriction, decreases nitric oxide

AB  - Mercury is an environmental pollutant that reduces nitric oxide (NO) 
      bioavailability and increases oxidative stress, having a close link with 
      cardiovascular diseases, as carotid atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, 
      coronary heart disease and hypertension. One of the main sites affected by 
      oxidative stress, which develops atherosclerosis, is the aorta. Under acute 
      exposure to low mercury concentrations reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
      were only reported for resistance vessels but if low concentrations of mercury 
      also affect conductance arteries it is still unclear. We investigated the acute 
      effects of 6 nM HgCl(2) on endothelial function of aortic rings measuring the 
      reactivity to phenylephrine in rings incubated, or not, with HgCl(2) for 45 min, 
      the protein expression for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and the AT1 receptor. HgCl(2) 
      increased Rmax and pD2 to phenylephrine without changing the vasorelaxation 
      induced by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Endothelial damage abolished 
      the increased reactivity to phenylephrine. The increase of Rmax and pD2 produced 
      by L-NAME was smaller in the presence of HgCl(2). Enalapril, losartan, 
      indomethacin, furegrelate, the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS 398, superoxide 
      dismutase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin reverted HgCl(2) effects on 
      the reactivity to phenylephrine, COX-2 protein expression was increased, and AT1 
      expression reduced. At low concentration, below the reference values, HgCl(2) 
      increased vasoconstrictor activity by reducing NO bioavailability due to 
      increased ROS production by NADPH oxidase activity. Results suggest that this is 
      due to local release of angiotensin II and prostanoid vasoconstrictors. Results 
      also suggest that acute low concentration mercury exposure, occurring time to 
      time could induce vascular injury due to endothelial oxidative stress and 
      contributing to increase peripheral resistance, being a high risk factor for 
      public health.

TI  - Angiotensin II stimulates increased protein synthesis, not increased DNA 
      synthesis, in intact rat aortic segments, in vitro.
PG  - 80-6
AB  - There is considerable controversy regarding whether angiotensin II (AngII) 
      stimulates hypertrophy or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). The 
      purpose of the present study was to determine whether stretch of the vessel wall 
      or AngII treatment increased protein or DNA synthesis in intact aortic rings in 
      vitro and whether stretch of the vessel wall altered the growth responses to 
      AngII. Rat aortic rings were mounted on steel supports in serum-free medium for 
      16 h and subjected to 0 or 1.5 g of preload (i.e. passive stretch). Fetal bovine 
      serum (13%, FBS) or AngII [1 microM, in the presence or absence of angiotensin 
      receptor antagonist, losartan (DuP753) 10 microM] was administered and isometric 
      tension development was measured. 35S-methionine (3 microCi/ml) was added to the 
      baths at 14-16 h for measurement of protein synthesis. Passive stretch did not 
      increase protein synthesis as compared to vessels mounted under no-preload 
      conditions. AngII and FBS elicited similar increases in isometric tension 
      development, but tension development in FBS-treated rings was sustained 4 times 
      longer than in rings treated with AngII. AngII and FBS increased protein 
      synthesis by 35 and 121%, respectively, but there was no difference in the extent 
      of contractile agonist-induced protein synthesis between rings subjected to 0 or 
      1.5 g of passive stretch. Losartan totally abolished AngII-induced tension 
      development and protein synthesis. AngII and FBS did not stimulate increased DNA 
      synthesis in aortic rings, as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. These 
      results suggest that AngII stimulates hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia of 
      fully contractile SMC in an intact vessel.

AB  - Cocktail phenotyping using specific probe drugs for cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
      provides information on the real-time activity of multiple CYPs. We investigated 
      different sample preparation techniques and validated a 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method with simple 
      protein precipitation for the analysis of nine CYP probe drugs and their 
      metabolites in human serum and urine. Specific CYP probe drugs (melatonin, 
      CYP1A2; nicotine, CYP2A6; bupropion, CYP2B6; repaglinide, CYP2C8; losartan, 
      CYP2C9; omeprazole, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4; dextromethorphan, CYP2D6; chlorzoxazone, 
      CYP2E; midazolam, CYP3A4) and their main metabolites, with the exception of 
      3'-hydroxyrepaglinide, were quantified in human serum and urine using the 
      developed LC-MS/MS method. The analytical method was fully validated showing high 
      selectivity, linearity, acceptable accuracy (85-115 %) and precision (2-19 %) and 
      applied to a pharmacokinetic study in four healthy volunteers after oral 
      administration of drugs given as a cocktail. All probe drugs and their 
      metabolites (totally 19 analytes) were detected and quantified from human serum 
      and urine over the time range of 1 to 6 h after oral administration. Therefore, 
      the proposed method is applicable for drug interaction and CYP phenotyping 
      studies utilizing a cocktail approach. Graphical Abstract Workflow overwiew of 
      cocktail CYP-phenotyping study.

TI  - Valsartan. A review of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in essential 
      hypertension.
PG  - 299-311
AB  - Valsartan competitively and selectively inhibits the actions of angiotensin II at 
      the AT1 receptor subtype which is responsible for most of the known effects of 
      angiotensin II. In clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate essential 
      hypertension valsartan was as effective as losartan, lisinopril, enalapril, 
      amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Addition of the latter reduced blood pressure 
      in patients who did not respond sufficiently to valsartan monotherapy. 
      Preliminary data also suggest valsartan may be effective in patients with severe 
      essential hypertension. The drug was as effective as lisinopril as treatment for 
      mild to moderate essential hypertension in patients with renal insufficiency and 
      did not worsen renal function. Headache, dizziness and fatigue were the most 
      common adverse events in placebo-controlled studies; the incidence of these 
      adverse events was not significantly different between placebo and valsartan 
      recipients. Compared with ACE inhibitors, valsartan was associated with a 
      significantly lower incidence of dry cough. Thus, valsartan is an effective 
      treatment for mild to moderate essential hypertension and may be particularly 
      useful in patients who experience persistent cough during ACE inhibitor therapy.

      antagonists (AT(1) blockers, ARBs, sartans) and their general properties and 
      similarities. Accordingly, their receptor profile, pharmacokinetic and 
      therapeutic applications are discussed. In addition, attention is paid to the

      of this category offer additional potentially beneficial properties, owing to 
      their pharmacological or metabolic characteristics. Such additional properties 
      are critically discussed for eprosartan, losartan, telmisartan and valsartan.

TI  - An integrated physiology-based model for the interaction of RAA system biomarkers 
      with drugs.
PG  - 417-28
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182676f06. [doi]
AB  - The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is a paramount target for the 
      pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular diseases. As modeling and simulation 
      techniques are becoming increasingly utilized in cardiovascular research, our aim 
      was to develop a physiology-based model that describes the effect of different 
      drugs at different doses on the RAAS and integrates physiology-based description 
      drug pharmacokinetics (PK). First, a basic RAAS model was developed in which 
      equations for drug effects were included and missing parameters estimated. Next, 
      a physiology-based PK model for enalapril and enalaprilat was developed and 
      coupled to the RAAS model. Simulation of the effects of angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aliskiren administration on 
      angiotensins I and II did not reveal significant overestimation or 
      underestimation. For all drugs, the error numerics were acceptable. The model 
      also encompassed the PK of intravenous and oral enalapril and its conversion to 
      enalaprilat. In summary, we report a physiology-based model for the interaction 
      of the RAAS biomarkers angiotensin I and II with enalapril, benazepril, 
      aliskiren, and losartan that allows for an adequate description of the RAAS 
      response after single administration of the drugs. Such a comprehensive 
      description may lead to a better understanding of the effects of pharmacological 
      interventions in the RAAS.

TI  - Candesartan cilexetil: an update of its use in essential hypertension.
PG  - 1253-87
AB  - Candesartan cilexetil is converted to the angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The selective and 
      competitive binding of candesartan to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor 
      prevents binding of angiotensin II, a key mediator in the renin-angiotensin 
      system. Significant reductions in systolic BP and diastolic BP are achieved with 
      a once-daily dosage of candesartan cilexetil 2 to 32 mg/day in patients with mild 
      to moderate hypertension. In randomised studies, candesartan cilexetil 8 to 16 
      mg/day was at least as effective as therapeutic dosages of losartan or other 
      angiotensin II receptor antagonists. At a dosage of up to 32 mg/day candesartan 
      cilexetil demonstrated greater antihypertensive efficacy than losartan 50 or 100 
      mg/day. In comparative trials, candesartan cilexetil demonstrated similar or 
      greater antihypertensive efficacy compared with enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide 
      and equivalent efficacy compared with amlodipine. The efficacy of candesartan 
      cilexetil is not affected by age, and the drug provided significant BP reductions 
      in Black patients and in those with severe hypertension. Long-term clinical 
      studies to assess the effects of treatment with candesartan cilexetil on 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are ongoing. Regression of left 
      ventricular hypertrophy has been seen with candesartan cilexetil treatment in 
      patients with hypertension. Furthermore, the drug has favourable effects on renal 
      function in patients with hypertension with or without coexisting diabetes 
      mellitus. Renal vascular resistance and albumin excretion were reduced following 
      treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism 
      were not affected by treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      Candesartan cilexetil is well tolerated and is not associated with cough, a 
      common adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment. A 
      pooled analysis of clinical trials found that the tolerability profile of 
      candesartan cilexetil is not significantly different from that of placebo. 
      Adverse events are not dose-related and are generally of mild to moderate 
      severity. CONCLUSIONS: Candesartan cilexetil is an effective antihypertensive 
      agent with a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo. Comparative data 
      indicate that candesartan cilexetil has antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to 
      that of other major classes of antihypertensive agents and has a long duration of 
      action. Therefore, candesartan cilexetil is a useful therapeutic option in the 
      management of patients with hypertension.

TI  - Telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide: in the treatment of essential hypertension.
PG  - 2013-26; discussion 2027-8
AB  - Oral telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combines two antihypertensive agents, 
      a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist with a long half-life and 
      once-daily administration, and a thiazide diuretic. In two large, 8-week, 
      double-blind trials, patients with hypertension unresponsive to monotherapy who 
      received combined telmisartan/HCTZ 80/12.5 or 40/12.5 mg/day, achieved 
      significantly larger reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP), 
      than recipients of continued telmisartan monotherapy (p < 0.05 for all). 
      Compliance with telmisartan/HCTZ 80/12.5 mg/day was 98.9%. In patients with 
      hypertension, telmisartan/HCTZ resulted in similar BP reductions to oral 
      enalapril/HCTZ and atenolol/HCTZ in 26-week double-blind trials and greater 
      reductions than oral losartan/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg/day in a 6-week randomised 
      open-label trial (p < 0.001). Up to one-third of patients with hypertension 
      initially responsive to telmisartan 40 or 80 mg/day in a 4-year study required 
      the eventual addition of HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg/day and/or another agent to maintain 
      BP control. BP was controlled in about 75% of these by adding only HCTZ. In 
      clinical trials of up to 4 years, including elderly patients, telmisartan/HCTZ 
      had similar tolerability to placebo, with few reports of hypokalaemia. Most 
      adverse events were mild to moderate.

TI  - Irbesartan: an updated review of its use in cardiovascular disorders.
PG  - 1187-206
AB  - Irbesartan interrupts the renin-angiotensin system via selective blockade of the 
      angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor; the latter being responsible for the pressor 
      related effects of angiotensin II. As treatment for mild to moderate 
      hypertension, irbesartan 150 mg/day controlled diastolic BP in 56% of patients 
      according to pooled data from several phase III studies and 77% of patients in a 
      large phase IV study. in comparative trials, irbesartan was significantly more 
      effective than losartan and valsartan as treatment for mild to moderate essential 
      hypertension and as effective as enalapril or atenolol. Results from many studies 
      show an additive antihypertensive effect when hydrochlorothiazide is added to 
      irbesartan monotherapy. The drug also induces statistically significant 
      regression of left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension and left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, and preliminary evidence suggests it has beneficial 
      haemodynamic effects in patients with heart failure. Irbesartan is very well 
      tolerated, exhibiting an adverse event profile similar to that seen with placebo 
      in comparative trials. In conclusion, although the role of irbesartan as a 
      treatment for heart failure is little clearer than it was 2 years ago, the place 
      of the drug in the management of hypertension is now better established. There is 
      evidence to suggest the drug may have a role as initial therapy for hypertension, 
      although formal recommendation in management guidelines will almost certainly not 
      occur until long term morbidity and mortality benefits are established.

TI  - Irbesartan: review of pharmacology and comparative properties.
PG  - 22-31
AB  - The recently developed and marketed angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers 
      (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy equivalent to that of other leading classes of 
      antihypertensive agents, with superior tolerability profiles. The specific 
      targeting of the AT1 receptor afforded by these agents has demonstrated more 
      complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than that offered by 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These data notwithstanding, 
      differentiation within the class of ARBs has been limited. With the accumulation 
      of additional data with ARBs, it has recently become possible to make 
      within-class distinctions, based in large part on the individual pharmacological 
      profiles of the ARBs. To this end, absorption, distribution, half-life, dose 
      response and level of angiotensin II antagonism are of special note. When these 
      properties are viewed as a group, the ARB irbesartan appears to offer advantages 
      beyond those attained with other ARBs. Irbesartan is well absorbed, does not 
      require biotransformation to an active metabolite to exert its antihypertensive 
      activity, offers a large volume of distribution, has a half-life that is 
      sufficient to allow once-daily dosing, is associated with a strong and consistent 
      dose-response and has been demonstrated to provide a level of angiotensin II 
      antagonism that is statistically superior to that offered by some other ARBs. 
      These pharmacological differences may explain the clinical superiority of 
      irbesartan compared with losartan, the first member of the ARB class. As even 
      more data on the ARBs become available, the ability to determine the advantages 
      of specific members of this class will be enhanced, distinctions that already 
      have begun to come to light.

TI  - Irbesartan: a review of its use in hypertension and in the management of diabetic 
      nephropathy.
PG  - 999-1028
AB  - Irbesartan (Avapro, Aprovel) is a potent and selective angiotensin II subtype 1 
      receptor antagonist indicated for use in patients with hypertension, including 
      those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Once-daily administration of 
      irbesartan provided 24-hour control of blood pressure (BP). In patients with 
      mild-to-moderate hypertension irbesartan was as effective as enalapril, atenolol 
      and amlodipine, and more effective than valsartan in terms of absolute reduction 
      in BP and response rates. Irbesartan produced a greater reduction in diastolic BP 
      at trough than once-daily losartan, but had a smaller effect than olmesartan; the 
      reduction in systolic BP achieved with irbesartan was similar or greater than 
      that with losartan and similar to that seen with olmesartan. The combination of 
      irbesartan with hydrochlorothiazide produced additive effects on BP reduction. 
      Irbesartan also induced regression of left ventricular mass in patients with 
      hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. In two large studies (IRbesartan 
      MicroAlbuminuria type 2 diabetes mellitus in hypertensive patients [IRMA 2] and 
      the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial [IDNT]) irbesartan exerted a 
      renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes at both the 
      early and later stages of diabetic nephropathy. The renoprotective effect was at 
      least partly independent of the BP-lowering effect. In the IRMA 2 trial, the 
      proportion of patients progressing to overt nephropathy was significantly lower 
      for recipients of irbesartan 300mg once daily than placebo. In patients with 
      overt nephropathy in the IDNT, irbesartan 300mg once daily provided significantly 
      greater renoprotection than amlodipine 10mg once daily or placebo. The relative 
      risk of doubling of serum creatinine was significantly lower with irbesartan than 
      amlodipine or placebo. Irbesartan is well tolerated in hypertensive patients, 
      including those with type 2 diabetes and incipient or overt nephropathy. The 
      overall incidence of adverse events with irbesartan was similar to that with 
      placebo. Irbesartan was associated with a lower incidence of cough than enalapril 
      and was not associated with ankle oedema or with any clinically significant drug 
      interactions. In conclusion, irbesartan is a well tolerated and effective 
      antihypertensive agent. It also slows the progression of renal disease in 
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes at both the early and later stages of 
      diabetic nephropathy. Thus, irbesartan is a valuable agent in the management of 
      patients with these indications.

LID - 10.1177/1470320310392618 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The hypertensive double-transgenic (dTG) rat strain, expressing 
      human renin and angiotensinogen, develops severe hypertension and organ damage 
      and 50% of individuals die by 7 weeks of age. Here, we characterise a variation 
      of this model in which animals present stable hypertension. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers on blood pressure was 
      determined with adult dTG rats treated with enalapril from 3 to 12 weeks of age. 
      Tissue expression levels of renin and angiotensinogen were determined in dTG rats 
      and rhesus monkeys by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Upon withdrawal from enalapril, 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) rose to 160-180 mmHg, with 95% of the female dTG 
      rats surviving for 6 to 12 months, In Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and rhesus 
      monkeys, renin mRNA was absent or weakly expressed in most tissues, except for 
      the kidneys and adrenals. In dTG rats, human renin expression was high in many 
      additional tissues. The expression of human angiotensinogen in dTG rats followed 
      a similar tissue pattern to SD and rhesus monkey angiotensinogen. Oral dosing of 
      aliskiren, enalapril or losartan provided a similar maximal reduction in MAP and 
      duration of efficacy in telemetrised dTG rats. CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril-pretreated 
      dTG rats are suitable for long-term MAP monitoring and sequential evaluation of 
      human renin inhibitors.

TI  - Pre-clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) of gefitinib or erlotinib with 
      Cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibiting drugs, fluoxetine and/or losartan.
PG  - 217-224
LID - 10.1016/j.crtox.2021.05.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between gefitinib or 
      erlotinib with fluoxetine, and/or losartan. METHODS: Human pooled microsomes, 
      supersomes, and cryopreserved human hepatocytes were used to monitor DDIs in 
      vitro. RED (Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis) protein binding was employed to 
      investigate other pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Gefitinib is significantly 
      metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4, with less than 80% of the 
      drug remaining. Erlotinib is significantly metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and 
      CYP1A2. Although gefitinib and erlotinib were metabolized by the same CYP 
      isoenzymes, the metabolites formed from degradation of the two drugs were 
      different.Fluoxetine inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolism of gefitinib with an 
      IC(50) of 65.12 ± 1.88 µM and 4.11 ± 2.26 µM, respectively. Fluoxetine also 
      inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolism of erlotinib with an IC(50) of 
      7.06 ± 1.54 µM and 4.57 ± 1.22 µM, respectively.For hepatocytes, fluoxetine 
      affected the metabolism of gefitinib or erlotinib, while losartan had no effect. 
      Gefitinib and erlotinib inhibited the metabolism of fluoxetine and losartan. 
      Two-drug combinations involving gefitinib or erlotinib with fluoxetine or 
      losartan yielded insignificant (p-value ≥ 0.05) differences in metabolism. 
      However, combinations involving three drugs yielded significant degrees of 
      inhibition (p-value ≤ 0.05). Three drug combinations involving fluoxetine and 
      losartan with gefitinib or erlotinib yielded significant degrees of inhibition of 
      the metabolism of gefitinib, but not for that of erlotinib. CONCLUSION: As could 
      be predicted by previous studies involving the inhibitory effect of fluoxetine on 
      CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and studies involving CYP metabolism of gefitinib and 
      erlotinib, the tests performed here confirmed that fluoxetine has an inhibitory 
      effect on metabolism of gefitinib or erlotinib by the main CYP isoenzymes 
      involved. This study suggests a variable inhibitory effect of fluoxetine 
      particularly on CYP2D6 activity towards gefitinib or erlotinib; erlotinib 
      metabolism is less affected. Likewise, the combination of fluoxetine and losartan 
      does not significantly affect hepatocyte metabolism of erlotinib, but does for 
      that of gefitinib. The results presented in this study thus indicate a need for 
      DDI assays to involve multiple drugs to properly study multidrug regimens.

TI  - Signaling cascade of ANG II-induced inhibition of alpha-MG uptake in renal 
      proximal tubule cells.
PG  - F634-42
AB  - ANG II and Na+-glucose cotransporter have been reported to be associated with the 
      onset of diverse renal diseases. However, the effect of ANG II on Na+-glucose 
      cotransporter activity was not elucidated. The effects of ANG II on 
      alpha-methyl-D-[14C]glucopyranoside (alpha-MG) uptake and its related signal 
      pathways were examined in the primary cultured rabbit renal proximal tubule cells 
      (PTCs). ANG II (>2 h; >10(-9) M) inhibited alpha-MG uptake in a time- and 
      concentration-dependent manner and decreased the protein level of Na+-glucose 
      cotransporters, the expression of which was abrogated by both actinomycin D and 
      cycloheximide exposure. ANG II-induced inhibition of alpha-MG uptake was blocked 
      by losartan, an ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, but not by PD-123319, an 
      ANG II type 2 receptor blocker. ANG II-induced inhibition of alpha-MG uptake was 
      blocked by genistein, herbimycin A [tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors], mepacrine, 
      and AACOCF3 (phospholipase A2 inhibitors), suggesting the role of TK 
      phosphorylation and arachidonic acid (AA). Indeed, ANG II increased AA release, 
      which was blocked by losartan or TK inhibitors. The effects of ANG II on AA 
      release and alpha-MG uptake also were abolished by staurosporine and 
      bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C inhibitors) or PD-98059 (p44/42 MAPK 
      inhibitor), but not SB-203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), respectively. Indeed, ANG II 
      increased p44/42 MAPK activity. ANG II-induced activation of p44/42 MAPK was 
      blocked by staurosporine. In conclusion, ANG II inhibited alpha-MG uptake via 
      PKC-MAPK-cPLA2 signal cascade through the AT1 receptor in the PTCs.

TI  - IGF-1 overexpression inhibits the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and 
      angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress.
PG  - 1414-24
AB  - Stimulation of the local renin-angiotensin system and apoptosis characterize the 
      diabetic heart. Because IGF-1 reduces angiotensin (Ang) II and apoptosis, we 
      tested whether streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy was attenuated in 
      IGF-1 transgenic mice (TGM). Diabetes progressively depressed ventricular 
      performance in wild-type mice (WTM) but had no hemodynamic effect on TGM. Myocyte 
      apoptosis measured at 7 and 30 days after the onset of diabetes was twofold 
      higher in WTM than in TGM. Myocyte necrosis was apparent only at 30 days and was 
      more severe in WTM. Diabetic nontransgenic mice lost 24% of their ventricular 
      myocytes and showed a 28% myocyte hypertrophy; both phenomena were prevented by 
      IGF-1. In diabetic WTM, p53 was increased in myocytes, and this activation of p53 
      was characterized by upregulation of Bax, angiotensinogen, Ang type 1 (AT(1)) 
      receptors, and Ang II. IGF-1 overexpression decreased these biochemical 
      responses. In vivo accumulation of the reactive O(2) product nitrotyrosine and 
      the in vitro formation of H(2)O(2)-(.)OH in myocytes were higher in diabetic WTM 
      than TGM. Apoptosis in vitro was detected in myocytes exhibiting high 
      H(2)O(2)-(.)OH fluorescence, and apoptosis in vivo was linked to the presence of 
      nitrotyrosine. H(2)O(2)-(.)OH generation and myocyte apoptosis in vitro were 
      inhibited by the AT(1) blocker losartan and the O(2) scavenger TIRON: In 
      conclusion, IGF-1 interferes with the development of diabetic myopathy by 
      attenuating p53 function and Ang II production and thus AT(1) activation. This 
      latter event might be responsible for the decrease in oxidative stress and 
      myocyte death by IGF-1.

TI  - Effects of add-on nebivolol on blood pressure and glucose parameters in 
      hypertensive patients with prediabetes.
PG  - 270-8
LID - 10.1111/jch.12071 [doi]
AB  - In this multicenter trial, the effects of nebivolol added to an 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker 
      (ARB) were assessed in patients with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 
      80-110 mm Hg) and prediabetes (fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL and/or 2-hour 
      oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] 140-199 mg/dL). After a 4-week run-in period 
      (in which lisinopril [10 mg/d] or losartan [50 mg/d] treatment was initiated), 
      patients with DBP 90-110 mm Hg were randomized (2:2:1) to 12-week, double-blind 
      treatment with nebivolol (n=223; 5-40 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; n=212; 
      12.5-25 mg/d), or placebo (n=102), titrated to achievement of 130/80 mm Hg. The 
      primary outcome measure was DBP (last observation carried forward, intent to 
      treat population); secondary measures included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
      glucose levels. At baseline, overall mean values for body mass index, 
      triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 32.3 kg/m(2) , 
      1.7 mmol/L, and 1.3 mmol/L, respectively. At week 12, nebivolol and placebo 
      groups demonstrated a decrease of -9.4 and -5.0 mm Hg, respectively (P<.001) for 
      DBP and -10.4 and -7.8 mm Hg for SBP (P=.147). The mean changes in area under the 
      curve OGTT were 0.0 mg/dL (nebivolol), 6.9 mg/dL (HCTZ; P=.024 vs nebivolol), and 
      -1.0 mg/dL (placebo). Adverse event-related discontinuation rates were 10.3%, 
      6.6%, and 2.0%, respectively. Nebivolol, added to an ACE inhibitor or ARB, 
      provides additional blood pressure reduction with little or no effect on glucose 
      metabolism in hypertensive patients with prediabetes.

AB  - A rapid and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      method for the simultaneous determination of organic anion transporting 
      polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and cytochrome P450 (P450) probe substrates and their 
      phase I metabolites in human plasma was developed. The OATP1B1 (pitavastatin) and 
      five P450 probe substrates, caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole 
      (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A) and their metabolites 
      were extracted from human plasma (50 µL) using methanol. Analytes were separated 
      on a C18 column followed by selected reaction monitoring detection using MS/MS. 
      All analytes were separated simultaneously within a 9 min run time. The developed 
      method was fully validated over the expected clinical concentration range for all 
      analytes tested. The intra- and inter-day precisions for all analytes were lower 
      than 11.3% and 8.82%, respectively, and accuracy was 88.5⁻117.3% and 96.1⁻109.2%, 
      respectively. The lower limit of quantitation was 0.05 ng/mL for 
      dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, midazolam, and 1'-hydroxymidazolam; 0.5 ng/mL for 
      losartan, EXP-3174, omeprazole, 5'-hydroxyomeprazole, and pitavastatin; and 5 
      ng/mL for caffeine and paraxanthine. The method was successfully used in a 
      pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects after oral doses of five P450 and 
      OATP1B1 probes. This analytical method provides a simple, sensitive, and accurate 
      tool for the determination of OATP1B1 and five major P450 activities in vivo drug 
      interaction studies.

TI  - Candesartan cilexetil: an angiotensin II-receptor blocker.
PG  - 739-46
AB  - The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, 
      and adverse effects of candesartan cilexetil are reviewed. Candesartan is an 
      angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB). It is administered as a pro-drug that 
      undergoes activation during gastrointestinal absorption. The agent is excreted 
      mostly unchanged and has a terminal half-life of about nine hours (slightly 
      longer in the elderly). Candesartan differs from other agents in its class in 
      that it is tightly bound to angiotensin II type 1 receptors, allowing prolonged 
      activity. In clinical trials, candesartan cilexetil has produced a dose-dependent 
      effect when given in dosages of 2-32 mg/day. Observed trough-to-peak blood 
      pressure ratios support a once-daily dosage regimen. The antihypertensive effect 
      of candesartan cilexetil 4-16 mg/day was as great as that of enalapril 10-20 
      mg/day and amlodipine 5 mg/day and larger than that of losartan potassium 50 
      mg/day. Adding candesartan cilexetil to hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25 mg/day and 
      amlodipine 5 mg/day led to enhanced blood-pressure reductions and was well 
      tolerated. It appears that candesartan can decrease renal perfusion without 
      adversely affecting renal blood flow and may mediate a decrease in albuminuria in 
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. No clinically important drug 
      interactions have been reported. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, 
      nausea, diarrhea, and transient elevations in liver transaminases. The frequency 
      of cough is similar to that seen with placebo. Candesartan cilexetil is an 
      effective antihypertensive agent that can be used alone or in combination with 
      other antihypertensive drugs. It is generally well tolerated and may be an option 
      for patients who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors because 
      of cough.

TI  - Angiotensin II-induced Ca2+ mobilization and prolactin release in normal and 
      hyperplastic pituitary cells.
PG  - E534-40
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.1998.274.3.E534 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated the effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) and its antagonists on 
      prolactin release, intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) mobilization, and 
      [3H]thymidine uptake in cells from normal rat pituitaries and from 
      estrogen-induced pituitary tumors. ANG II (10(-7) to 10(-9) M) increased 
      prolactin release significantly in control and not in tumoral cells. In control 
      cells, ANG II (10(-6) to 10(-9) M) produced an immediate spike of [Ca2+]i 
      followed by a plateau. Spike levels rose significantly between 10(-10) and 10(-8) 
      M ANG II, whereas the onset of the spike was retarded with decreasing 
      concentrations. In tumoral cells, ANG II did not produce a spike phase even at 
      10(-6) M. ANG II-induced prolactin release and calcium mobilization were blocked 
      by losartan (AT1 receptor antagonist) and not by PD-123319 (AT2 antagonist). 
      Finally, [3H]thymidine uptake was not modified by ANG II (10(-7) to 10(-10) M) or 
      its antagonists in either group. Our results suggest that chronic in vivo 
      estrogenic treatment alters in vitro pituitary response to ANG II. Alterations 
      might function to limit excessive prolactin secretion of hypersecreting tumors. 
      Besides, ANG II does not modify DNA synthesis in vitro of cells from normal or 
      tumor-derived hypophyses.

TI  - Formulation and Preparation of Losartan-Potassium-Loaded Controlled-Release 
      Matrices Using Ethocel Grade 10 to Establish a Correlation between In Vitro and 
      In Vivo Results.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16020186 [doi]
LID - 186
AB  - In the current study, matrices of losartan potassium were formulated with two 
      different polymers (Ethocel 10 premium and Ethocel 10FP premium), along with a 
      filler and a lubricant, at different drug-to-polymer w/w ratios (10:3, 10:4, and 
      10:5). The matrices were tested by the direct compression method, and their 
      hardness, diameter, thickness, friability, weight variation, content uniformity, 
      and in vitro dissolution tests were assessed to determine 24-h drug release 
      rates. The matrices with Ethocel 10 FP at a 10:4 ratio exhibited 
      pseudo-zero-order kinetics (n-value of 0.986), while the dissolution data of the 
      test matrices and reference tablets did not match. The new test-optimized 
      matrices were also tested in rabbits, and their pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      investigated: half-life (11.78 ± 0.018 h), Tmax (2.105 ± 1.131 h), C(max) (205.98 
      ± 0.321 μg/mL), AUC(o) (5931.10 ± 1.232 μg·h/mL), AUC(o-inf) (7348.46 ± 0.234 
      μg·h/mL), MRT(o-48h) (17.34 ± 0.184 h), and Cl (0.002 ± 0.134 mL/min). A 
      correlation value of 0.985 between the in vitro and in vivo results observed for 
      the test-optimized matrices was observed, indicating a level-A correlation 
      between the percentage of the drug released in vitro and the percentage of the 
      drug absorbed in vivo. The matrices might improve patient compliance with 
      once-a-day dosing and therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The O-[(11)C]methylated derivatives of the clinically used 
      neprilysin inhibitor (NEPi) sacubitril ([(11)C]SacOMe, (2R,4S)-ethyl 
      5-([biphenyl]-4-yl)-4-(4-[(11)C]methoxy-4-oxobutanamido)-2-methylpentanoate) and 
      LBQ657 ([(11)C]MeOLBQ, 
      (2R,4S)-5-(biphenyl-4-yl)-4-[(3-carboxypropionyl)amino]-2-methylpentanoic acid 
      [(11)C]methyl ester and [(11)C]LBQOMe, 
      (2R,4S)-5-(biphenyl-4-yl)-4-[(4-[(11)C]methoxy-4-oxobutanamido)]-2-methylpentanoic 
      acid) were evaluated to determine their potential as PET imaging tracers and 
      investigate the effect of such labeling esterification on neprilysin (NEP) 
      binding. METHODS: [(11)C]MeOLBQ, [(11)C]SacOMe and [(11)C]LBQOMe were synthesized 
      by O-[(11)C]methylation using [(11)C]methyl triflate. Binding of these 
      radiolabeled derivatives (5 nM) were assessed by autoradiography on rat 
      neprilysin rich kidney slices with or without 10 μM NEPi (thiorphan or 
      sacubitril) for 20 min at 37 °C. [(11)C]LBQOMe was further tested for binding 
      selectivity in the presence of 10 μM of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
      (ACEi, captopril) or angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blocker (AT1R, losartan). 
      Radioligands were evaluated for their in vitro stability up to 20 min after 
      incubation at 37 °C in rat and human plasma by reverse-phase column-switch HPLC. 
      Non-radioactive SacOMe incubated in rat and human plasma was analyzed by 
      HPLC-coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to confirm the 
      metabolites' identity. [(11)C]SacOMe main labeled metabolite was further analyzed 
      by HPLC after incubation in rat kidney slices at 37 °C. RESULTS: The novel 
      [(11)C]SacOMe and [(11)C]LBQOMe were produced in 32 ± 3% RCY and 15 ± 6% at EOS 
      (decay-corrected from [(11)C]CO(2), n = 3), high molar activity 
      (407 ± 92 GBq/μmol and 260 ± 92 GBq/μmol), and high chemical (≥90%) and 
      radiochemical (≥99%) purities in a total synthesis time of 31 and 34 min, 
      respectively. High accumulation of [(11)C]SacOMe and [(11)C]LBQOMe in kidneys was 
      completely blocked (>99.9%) by pre-incubation with NEPi, whereas [(11)C]MeOLBQ 
      displayed negligible uptake in autoradiography studies. [(11)C]LBQOMe binding was 
      not affected by saturating doses of losartan or captopril indicating binding 
      selectivity for NEP. While [(11)C]SacOMe and [(11)C]LBQOMe were stable in human 
      plasma (>92%) even after 20 min incubation at 37 °C, rat plasma analyses 
      exhibited >95% biotransformation of [(11)C]SacOMe, 40% of [(11)C]LBQOMe and >80% 
      loss of the (11)C-methyl group of [(11)C]MeOLBQ after 5 min of incubation. 
      Comparable results using the non-radioactive SacOMe were obtained by HPLC-HRMS. 
      Radio-HPLC analysis of the extracted activity of rat kidney slices incubated with 
      [(11)C]SacOMe demonstrated that >95% of the radioactive signal corresponded to 
      [(11)C]LBQOMe as the main metabolite. CONCLUSION: The desethyl active metabolite 
      of [(11)C]SacOMe, [(11)C]LBQOMe, displayed stability in human plasma, binding 
      selectivity for neprilysin over ACE or AT1R in rat kidney slices. Rapid plasmatic 
      dealkylation at the 2-methylbutanoic acid position is in line with the necessity 
      of incorporating the labeling group on oxobutanoic acid side in the strategy to 
      develop a stable O-alkylated labeled derivative of sacubitril.

AB  - Renal nerve stimulation at a low frequency (below 2 Hz) causes water and sodium 
      reabsorption via α1-adrenoreceptor tubular activation, a process independent of 
      changes in systemic blood pressure, renal blood flow, or glomerular filtration 
      rate. However, the underlying mechanism of the reabsorption of sodium is not 
      fully understood. Since the sympathetic nervous system and intrarenal ANG II 
      appear to act synergistically to mediate the process of sodium reabsorption, we 
      hypothesized that low-frequency acute electrical stimulation of the renal nerve 
      (ESRN) activates NHE3-mediated sodium reabsorption via ANG II AT1 receptor 
      activation in Wistar rats. We found that ESRN significantly increased urinary 
      angiotensinogen excretion and renal cortical ANG II content, but not the 
      circulating angiotensinogen levels, and also decreased urinary flow and pH and 
      sodium excretion via mechanisms independent of alterations in creatinine 
      clearance. Urinary cAMP excretion was reduced, as was renal cortical PKA 
      activity. ESRN significantly increased NHE3 activity and abundance in the apical 
      microvillar domain of the proximal tubule, decreased the ratio of phosphorylated 
      NHE3 at serine 552/total NHE3, but did not alter total cortical NHE3 abundance. 
      All responses mediated by ESRN were completely abolished by a losartan-mediated 
      AT1 receptor blockade. Taken together, our results demonstrate that higher 
      NHE3-mediated proximal tubular sodium reabsorption induced by ESRN occurs via 
      intrarenal renin angiotensin system activation and triggering of the AT1 
      receptor/inhibitory G-protein signaling pathway, which leads to inhibition of 
      cAMP formation and reduction of PKA activity.

TI  - Drug interactions with angiotensin receptor blockers: a comparison with other 
      antihypertensives.
PG  - 707-20
AB  - The ever-increasing introduction of new therapeutic agents means that the 
      potential for drug interactions is likely to escalate. Numerous different classes 
      of drugs are currently used to treat hypertension. The angiotensin receptor 
      blockers offer one of the newest approaches to the management of patients with 
      high blood pressure. Compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents, the 
      angiotensin receptor blockers appear overall to have a low potential for drug 
      interactions, but variations within the class have been detected. Losartan and 
      irbesartan have a greater affinity for cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoenzymes and, 
      thus, are more likely to be implicated in drug interactions. There is 
      pharmacokinetic evidence to suggest that such interactions could have a clinical 
      impact. Candesartan cilexetil, valsartan and eprosartan have variable but 
      generally modest affinity and telmisartan has no affinity for any of the CYP 
      isoenzymes. In vitro studies and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation can 
      provide evidence for some interactions, but only a relatively small number of 
      drug combinations are usually studied in this way. The absence of any 
      pharmacokinetic evidence of drug interaction, however, should not lead to 
      complacency. Patients should be made aware of possible interactions, especially 
      involving the concurrent use of over-the-counter products, and it may be prudent 
      for all patients receiving antihypertensive treatment to be monitored for 
      possible drug interactions at their regular check-ups. The physician can help by 
      prescribing agents with a low potential for interaction, such as angiotensin 
      receptor blockers.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor antagonists role in arterial hypertension.
PG  - S93-9
AB  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers represent a class of effective and well 
      tolerated orally active antihypertensive drugs. Activation of AT(1) receptors 
      leads to vasoconstriction, stimulation of the release of catecholamines and 
      antidiuretic hormone and promote growth of vascular and cardiac muscle. AT(1) 
      receptor blockers antagonise all those effects. Losartan was the first drug of 
      this class marketed, shortly followed by valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan, 
      candesartan, eprosartan and others on current investigation. All these drugs have 
      the common properties of blockading the AT(1) receptor thereby relaxing vascular 
      smooth muscle, increase salt excretion, decrease cellular hypertrophy and induce 
      antihypertensive effect without modifying heart rate or cardiac output. Most of 
      the AT(1) receptor blockers in use controlled blood pressure during the 24 h with 
      a once-daily dose, without evidence of producing tolerance to the 
      antihypertensive effect and being with low incidence of side effects even at long 
      term use. Monotherapy in mild-to-moderate hypertension controls blood pressure in 
      40 to 50% of these patients; when a low dose of thiazide diuretic is added, 
      60-70% of patients are controlled. The efficacy is similar to 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, calcium antagonists 
      and beta-blocking agents. AT(1) receptor blockers are specially indicated in 
      patients with hypertension who are being treated with ACE inhibitors and 
      developed side effects such as, cough or angioedema. The final position in the 
      antihypertensive therapy in this special population and other clinical 
      situations, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetes 
      mellitus and renal disease, has to be determined in large prospective clinical 
      trials, some of which are now being conducted and seem promising.

AB  - Pharmacokinetic alterations of medications administered during surgeries 
      involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
      (ECMO) have been reported. The impact of CPB on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      enzymes' activity is the key factor. The metabolic rates of caffeine, 
      dextromethorphan, midazolam, omeprazole, and Losartan to the CYP-specific 
      metabolites are validated measures of in vivo CYP 1A2, 2D6, 3A4, 2C19, and 2C9 
      activities, respectively. The study aim is to assess the activities of major CYPs 
      in patients on extracorporeal circulation (EC). This is a pilot, prospective, 
      open-label, observational study in patients undergoing surgery using EC and 
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a control group. CYP 
      activities will be measured on the day, and 1-2 days pre-surgery/3-4 days 
      post-surgery (cardiac surgery and Laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and 1-2 days 
      after starting ECMO, 1-2 weeks after starting ECMO, and 1-2 days after 
      discontinuation from ECMO. Aforementioned CYP substrates will be administered to 
      the patient and blood samples will be collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-dose. 
      Major CYP enzymes' activities will be compared in each participant on the day, 
      and before/after surgery. The CYP activities will be compared in three study 
      groups to investigate the impact of CYPs on EC.

TI  - Use of Angiotensin receptor blockers in cardiovascular protection: current 
      evidence and future directions.
PG  - 22-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To differentiate angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) by vascular 
      effects and outcomes in trials on cardio-protective endpoints. DATA SOURCES: 
      MEDLINE searches were conducted from January 2003 to March 2009 using the 
      following search terms: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade or 
      inhibition; angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs); cardio-protection; vascular 
      protection; end-organ protection; candesartan; eprosartan, irbesartan; losartan; 
      olmesartan; telmisartan; and valsartan. Ongoing and recruiting clinical trials 
      were identified via Clinicaltrials.gov (July 2008). STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      ABSTRACTION: Pertinent basic science research and clinical trials with 
      cardiovascular endpoints and information from reviews, American Heart Association 
      2009 statistics, and The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on 
      Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 
      guidelines were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: ARBs differ in their 
      vascular protective pleiotropic effects and pharmacokinetic properties, which may 
      contribute to their pharmacological protection to reduce cardiovascular morbidity 
      and mortality, independently of their blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects. 
      CONCLUSION: Emerging data show that ARBs are effective in hypertension, left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, postmyocardial infarction, and heart failure. To what 
      extent their pleiotropic effects, independent of BP lowering, contribute to these 
      outcomes will be the focus of research in the coming years. Well-designed, 
      comparative-effectiveness studies are needed to clinically differentiate this 
      class of agents. The future will be marked by multifunctional ARBs that will 
      pharmacologically do more than antagonize the angiotensin type I (AT(1)) 
      receptor.

TI  - Telmisartan: a different angiotensin II receptor blocker protecting a different 
      population?
PG  - 1662-79
AB  - The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint 
      Trial (ONTARGET()) showed that the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) 
      telmisartan was as protective as the reference-standard ramipril in a broad 
      cross-section of patients at increased cardiovascular risk, but was better 
      tolerated. Telmisartan has a unique profile among ARBs, with a high affinity for 
      the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, a long duration of receptor binding, a high 
      lipophilicity and a long plasma half life. This leads to sustained and powerful 
      blood pressure lowering when compared with the first marketed ARBs, such as 
      losartan and valsartan. Some pharmacological properties of telmisartan clearly 
      distinguish it from other members of the ARB class and may contribute to the 
      clinical effects seen with telmisartan. A class effect for ARBs cannot be 
      assumed. To date, telmisartan is the only ARB that has been shown to reduce 
      cardiovascular risk in at-risk cardiovascular patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 epidemic grows and there are clinical trials of 
      antivirals. There is an opportunity to complement these trials with investigation 
      of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) because an ARB (losartan) was 
      effective in murine influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our innovative 
      design includes: ARBs; alignment with the WHO Ordinal Scale (primary endpoint) to 
      align with other COVID-19 trials; joint longitudinal analysis; and predictive 
      biomarkers (angiotensins I, 1-7, II and ACE1 and ACE2). Our hypothesis is: ARBs 
      decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, 
      vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) 
      or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged 
      multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and 
      effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) 
      out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by 
      ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint 
      longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of 
      ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether 
      continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 
      cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 
      patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing 
      WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This study has core institution approval (UBC Providence 
      Healthcare Research Ethics Board) and site institution approvals (Health Research 
      Ethics Board, University of Alberta; Comite d'etique de la recerche, CHU Sainte 
      Justine (for McGill University and University of Sherbrook); Conjoint Health

TI  - Lercanidipine in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 465-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature regarding the efficacy, tolerability, and 
      utility of lercanidipine in the treatment of hypertension. DATA SOURCES: A search 
      of the literature was performed using MEDLINE (1966-September 2006), EMBASE Drugs 
      and Pharmacology (1980-September 2006), and Current Contents/Clinical Medicine 
      (week 24, 2005-week 30, 2006). Package inserts from lercanidipine, nifedipine, 
      felodipine, and amlodipine were also reviewed for comparison of adverse effects. 
      STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were limited to clinical trials, 
      abstracts, and review articles published in English. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      Lercanidipine is a novel dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium-channel blocker indicated 
      for the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Although it is not yet 
      available in the US, lercanidipine has been utilized extensively in other 
      countries. In 2 randomized controlled trials of approximately 400 patients with 
      mild-to-moderate hypertension, lercanidipine showed efficacy similar to that of 2 
      other DHPs, felodipine and slow-release nifedipine, in significantly reducing 
      systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 4 weeks. In a 
      longer trial (12 mo), lercanidipine 10 mg/day led to normalized blood pressure in 
      49% of patients after 4 weeks. A postmarketing trial of 9050 patients 
      corroborated the results observed in previous clinical trials, with 64% of 
      patients achieving a DBP of less than 90 mm Hg and 32% attaining blood pressure 
      control (<140/90 mm Hg). In elderly patients, lercanidipine was found comparable 
      with lacidipine and nifedipine, showing similar decreases in DBP when compared 
      with nifedipine (-18.3 vs -17.7 mm Hg, respectively). What distinguishes 
      lercanidipine from other members of the DHP class is its lower incidence of 
      adverse effects, particularly edema. One study showed that fewer patients 
      withdrew secondary to adverse drug reactions in the lercanidipine (0.9%) and 
      nifedipine (3.8%) group compared with the felodipine (4.5%) group. Lercanidipine 
      has also shown efficacy similar to that of other antihypertensives, including 
      atenolol, captopril, and losartan. CONCLUSIONS: Lercanidipine may be an option in 
      the treatment of hypertension, as current literature suggests comparable 
      antihypertensive efficacy and better tolerability. Further randomized, 
      double-blind clinical trials must be conducted in order to clarify its position 
      among other antihypertensive medications.

      Simultaneous Determination of Losartan Potassium and Ramipril in Tablets.
PG  - 201-10
LID - 10.4103/0250-474X.106061 [doi]
AB  - A stability-indicating reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method has been 
      developed and validated for simultaneous determination of losartan potassium and 
      ramipril. Separations were achieved using a C(18) column with mobile phase 
      consisting of acetonitrile and (0.2% v/v, pH 2.5) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid 
      (45:55, v/v) in isocratic mode at 1 ml/min flow rate. Column effluent was 
      monitored at 210 nm using a UV detector. The method was validated for 
      selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and robustness. Novel 
      microwave-assisted forced degradation technique was employed for evaluation of 
      selectivity. The method demonstrated excellent linearity for losartan potassium 
      and ramipril with regression coefficients of 0.9999 and 0.9998, respectively. The 
      linearity range was found to be 62.5-5000 ng/ml and 125-10,000 ng/ml with the 
      mean percentage recoveries of 100.36% (±2.27) and 100.16% (±3.33) for losartan 
      potassium and ramipril, respectively. In a robustness study, a full factorial 
      design revealed that the analytical response remains unaffected by small 
      variations in the critical chromatographic factors. The method was found to be 
      sensitive with quantification limits of 44.30 and 79.93 ng/ml for losartan 
      potassium and ramipril. The method was successfully employed for the 
      determination of losartan potassium and ramipril in commercially available and 
      in-house prepared tablets.

TI  - Additive effects of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and 
      angiotensin II antagonism on blood pressure and renin release in sodium-depleted 
      normotensives.
PG  - 825-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not decrease plasma 
      angiotensin (Ang) II levels 24 hours after drug intake to the same extent as at 
      peak. This intermittent partial "escape" is explained either by a renin-mediated 
      reactive rise in plasma Ang I or by non-ACE-dependent Ang II generation. We 
      therefore tested the hypothesis that a combination of ACE inhibition and Ang II 
      blockade may have additive biological and hemodynamic effects. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: In a single-dose, double-blind, randomized, four-way, crossover study, 
      an Ang II antagonist (losartan 50 mg), an ACE inhibitor (captopril 50 mg), their 
      combination, and matched placebos were orally administered to 12 normotensive 
      male volunteers maintained in mild sodium depletion. When captopril 50 mg and 
      losartan 50 mg were given alone, the magnitude of their effects on blood 
      pressure, plasma active renin, Ang I, and aldosterone was similar, whereas the 
      kinetics of their effects were different, reflecting differences in drug 
      pharmacokinetics. The losartan-captopril combination completely suppressed the 
      rise in plasma Ang II induced by losartan 2 hours after drug intake (3.3 +/- 3.6 
      pg/mL versus 20.3 +/- 19.1 pg/mL, respectively, P < .05). Six hours after drug 
      intake, the losartan-captopril combination induced a significantly greater 
      decrease in mean blood pressure than that produced by either losartan or 
      captopril alone (73 +/- 7 mm Hg versus 79 +/- 8 mm Hg versus 81 +/- 7 mm Hg, 
      respectively, P < .05). The maximum placebo-subtracted falls in mean blood 
      pressure for the losartan-captopril combination, captopril 50 mg, and losartan 50 
      mg were 14 +/- 5 mm Hg, 10 +/- 3 mm Hg, and 9 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively (F2.22 = 
      3.45, P < .05). The duration of the mean blood pressure fall was not prolonged by 
      the combination. After combined losartan-captopril administration, the area under 
      the plasma active renin versus time curve (0 to 24 hours) was significantly 
      increased when compared with either losartan or captopril alone (6404 +/- 2961 
      pg.h.mL-1 versus 3105 +/- 1461 pg.h.mL-1 versus 2092 +/- 867 pg.h.mL-1, 
      respectively, P < .05). The combination had no additive effects on plasma 
      aldosterone decrease when compared with either losartan or captopril alone (58 
      +/- 17% versus 51 +/- 20% versus 53 +/- 21%, respectively, NS). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      combined administration of a standard single oral dose of an ACE inhibitor and an 
      Ang II antagonist to mildly sodium-depleted normal subjects (1) had a major 
      additive effect on plasma renin rise, (2) induced an additional mean blood 
      pressure reduction, and (3) had no additive effect on plasma aldosterone fall.

TI  - Effect of Angiotensin II on ENaC in the Distal Convoluted Tubule and in the 
      Cortical Collecting Duct of Mineralocorticoid Receptor Deficient Mice.
PG  - e014996
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.119.014996 [doi]
LID - e014996
AB  - Background Angiotensin II stimulates epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) by 
      aldosterone-independent mechanism. We now test the effect of angiotensin II on 
      ENaC in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) of 
      wild-type (WT) and kidney-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mice 
      (KS-MR-KO). Methods and Results We used electrophysiological, immunoblotting and 
      renal-clearance methods to examine the effect of angiotensin II on ENaC in 
      KS-MR-KO and wild-type mice. High K(+) intake stimulated ENaC in the late 
      DCT/early connecting tubule (DCT2/CNT) and in the CCD whereas low sodium intake 
      stimulated ENaC in the CCD but not in the DCT2/CNT. The deletion of MR abolished 
      the stimulatory effect of high K(+) and low sodium intake on ENaC, partially 
      inhibited ENaC in DCT2/CNT but almost abolished ENaC activity in the CCD. 
      Application of losartan inhibited ENaC only in DCT2/CNT of both wild-type and 
      KS-MR-KO mice but not in the CCD. Angiotensin II infusion for 3 days has a larger 
      stimulatory effect on ENaC in the DCT2/CNT than in the CCD. Three lines of 
      evidence indicate that angiotensin II can stimulate ENaC by MR-independent 
      mechanism: (1) angiotensin II perfusion augmented ENaC expression in KS-MR-KO 
      mice; (2) angiotensin II stimulated ENaC in the DCT2/CNT but to a lesser degree 
      in the CCD in KS-MR-KO mice; (3) angiotensin II infusion augmented 
      benzamil-induced natriuresis, increased the renal K(+) excretion and corrected 
      hyperkalemia of KS-MR-KO mice. Conclusions Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of 
      ENaC occurs mainly in the DCT2/CNT and to a lesser degree in the CCD and MR plays 
      a dominant role in determining ENaC activity in the CCD but to a lesser degree in 
      the DCT2/CNT.

TI  - Drugs Commonly Applied to Kidney Patients May Compromise Renal Tubular Uremic 
      Toxins Excretion.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12060391 [doi]
LID - 391
AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the secretion of uremic toxins is compromised 
      leading to their accumulation in blood, which contributes to uremic 
      complications, in particular cardiovascular disease. Organic anion transporters 
      (OATs) are involved in the tubular secretion of protein-bound uremic toxins 
      (PBUTs). However, OATs also handle a wide range of drugs, including those used 
      for treatment of cardiovascular complications and their interaction with PBUTs is 
      unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between 
      commonly prescribed drugs in CKD and endogenous PBUTs with respect to 
      OAT1-mediated uptake. We exposed a unique conditionally immortalized proximal 
      tubule cell line (ciPTEC) equipped with OAT1 to a panel of selected drugs, 
      including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs: captopril, 
      enalaprilate, lisinopril), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs: losartan and 
      valsartan), furosemide and statins (pravastatin and simvastatin), and evaluated 
      the drug-interactions using an OAT1-mediated fluorescein assay. We show that 
      selected ARBs and furosemide significantly reduced fluorescein uptake, with the 
      highest potency for ARBs. This was exaggerated in presence of some PBUTs. 
      Selected ACEIs and statins had either no or a slight effect at supratherapeutic 
      concentrations on OAT1-mediated fluorescein uptake. In conclusion, we demonstrate 
      that PBUTs may compete with co-administrated drugs commonly used in CKD 
      management for renal OAT1 mediated secretion, thus potentially compromising the 
      residual renal function.

TI  - Fixed combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in the management of 
      hypertension.
PG  - 213-24
AB  - Approximately 25% of the adult population worldwide is hypertensive and thus at 
      risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of many 
      antihypertensive drugs, at least 50% of patients do not achieve blood pressure 
      (BP) targets and thus remain at increased cardiovascular risk. Fixed-dose (FD) 
      irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is an antihypertensive combination therapy 
      approved for the treatment of patients whose BP is not adequately controlled on 
      monotherapy and for initial treatment of patients likely to need multiple drugs 
      to achieve their BP goal. The efficacy and tolerability of FD irbesartan/HCTZ has 
      been demonstrated in both patient populations in large multicenter studies. In 
      patients failing antihypertensive monotherapy, FD irbesartan/HCTZ (150/12.5 mg) 
      has been shown to be more effective than FD valsartan/HCTZ (80/12.5 mg) and at 
      least comparable to FD losartan/HCTZ (50/12.5 mg). In patients with moderate or 
      severe hypertension receiving FD irbesartan/HCTZ as initial therapy, this 
      combination achieved more rapid BP reductions compared with irbesartan 
      monotherapy and enabled a greater proportion of patients with severe hypertension 
      to achieve their BP target. FD irbesartan/HCTZ is thus a valuable addition to the 
      clinician's armamentarium for the management of hypertension and should help more 
      patients achieve their BP target.

TI  - Implementing losartan potassium-laden pegylated nanocubic vesicles as a novel

AB  - AIMS: Losartan potassium-laden pegylated nanocubic vesicles (LP-NCVs-PEG) have an 
      intriguing kidney-targeted nanoplatform for acute renal injury via blocking 
      apoptosis and activating wnt/β-catenin pathway. MAIN METHODS: Utilizing a 
      thin-film hydration methodology established on 4(2) full factorial design to 
      produce LP loaded nanocubic formulations (LP-NCVs) which composed mainly from 
      L-α-phosphatidylcholine and poloxamer. The optimization process was designed to 
      select the formulation with maximum entrapment efficiency (EE %), maximum 
      in-vitro drug release (Q(8h)), and minimum vesicle size (VS). The optimum 
      formulation was then pegylated to obtain LP-NCVs-PEG formulation that shields 
      NCVs from the harsh ecosystem of the stomach, improves their oral drug delivery 
      performance and targets the proximal renal tubules with no systemic toxicity. 
      Male albino rats were injected with Cisplatin (6 mg/kg, i.p.) alone or with 
      LP-formulations (5 mg/kg/day). Kidney injury markers, inflammatory markers, 
      apoptotic markers. Besides renal tissue expression of Wnt, β-Catenin, GSK-3β, 
      renal RNA gene expression of TCF-4, LEF-1 and histopathology were also analyzed 
      to display pharmacological study. KEY FINDINGS: The pharmacokinetics studies 
      demonstrated that LP-NCVs-PEG boosted LP bioavailability approximately 3.61 times 
      compared to LP oral solution. Besides LP-NCVs-PEG may have an intriguing 
      kidney-targeted nanoplatform for acute renal injury via decreased renal toxicity 
      markers, renal expression of LEF-1, GSK3-β, caspase, TNF-α, NF-κB and TUNEL 
      expression. Alternatively, increased renal tissue level of Bcl-2, wnt, β-catenin 
      and TCF-4. SIGNIFICANCE: LP-NCVs-PEG improved LP pharmacokinetics targeting the 
      kidney and improved injury by activating wnt/β-catenin/TCF-4 pathway, blocking 
      apoptosis, inflammation and renal toxicity markers suggesting it might be 
      successful nephroprotective adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Aliskiren: a review of its use in the management of hypertension.
PG  - 1767-92
AB  - Aliskiren (Tekturna) is an orally active, nonpeptidic inhibitor of renin, the 
      enzyme involved in the initial and rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin 
      system (RAS). In the US, aliskiren is approved for the treatment of hypertension 
      and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 
      Monotherapy with aliskiren 150-300mg once daily was effective in lowering blood 
      pressure (BP) and providing 24-hour BP control; it was generally well tolerated 
      when administered for up to 1 year to patients with mild to moderate 
      hypertension. In the short term (1-3 months), the BP-lowering effect of aliskiren 
      150-300mg once daily was significantly greater than that of hydrochlorothiazide 
      (HCTZ) 12.5-25mg once daily and noninferior to, or significantly greater than, 
      that of ramipril 5-10mg once daily. It was similar to that of valsartan 160-320mg 
      once daily and losartan 100mg once daily, and similar to, or significantly 
      greater than, that of irbesartan 150mg once daily. Aliskiren provided significant 
      additional BP-lowering effects when combined with HCTZ 12.5-25 mg/day, ramipril 
      5-10 mg/day, amlodipine 5mg once daily or valsartan 160-320 mg/day; combination 
      therapy was well tolerated. Long-term administration of aliskiren-based therapy 
      was superior to HCTZ- and ramipril-based therapies in lowering BP after 6 months, 
      and was similarly well tolerated. The ultimate role of aliskiren will be 
      determined by the results of target organ protection studies, which are ongoing, 
      and a cardiovascular outcome trial, which is planned. Nonetheless, by offering a 
      new approach to the blockade of the RAS, aliskiren provides a useful addition to 
      the therapeutic options available to treat patients with mild to moderate 
      hypertension.

AB  - Aliskiren is an orally administered, nonpeptide direct renin inhibitor indicated 
      for the management of hypertension. Aliskiren was effective in controlling blood 
      pressure (BP) as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensives, in 
      large, randomized trials. Aliskiren 150-300 mg/day as monotherapy was effective 
      in lowering BP across short- (≤12 weeks) and longer-term (up to 54 weeks) 
      periods, providing sustained and consistent effects with 24-hour BP control. 
      Compared with other antihypertensives, aliskiren was generally as effective as 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), valsartan, losartan, irbesartan and lisinopril in 
      reducing BP. Furthermore, short-term aliskiren was noninferior to ramipril in 
      reducing BP, but with a longer treatment duration, a greater efficacy of 
      aliskiren-based therapy over ramipril-based therapy was demonstrated. Additional 
      BP-lowering effects occurred when aliskiren was coadministered (as a fixed-dose 
      combination or separate tablets) with other antihypertensives, including HCTZ, 
      valsartan and amlodipine, according to large, randomized trials of short- (≤12 
      weeks) and longer-term (up to 54 weeks) duration. Combination therapy with 
      aliskiren plus HCTZ was effective in hypertensive patients when administered as 
      initial therapy or to patients previously treated with HCTZ or aliskiren 
      monotherapy. Aliskiren-based therapy was also effective in lowering BP in obese 
      patients, patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, patients with metabolic 
      syndrome and the elderly. Aliskiren efficacy was observed irrespective of patient 
      age, sex or ethnicity. Aliskiren monotherapy or combination therapy was generally 
      well tolerated over short- and longer-term study durations in large, randomized 
      clinical trials. Clinical trials to evaluate the effects of aliskiren on clinical 
      outcomes, including renoprotective and cardioprotective effects, are currently 
      ongoing. Thus, aliskiren is a useful option for the treatment of patients with 
      stage 1 to stage 2 (mild to moderate) hypertension, alone or in combination with 
      other antihypertensives, including HCTZ, valsartan or amlodipine.

AB  - NDMA is a semivolatile organic chemical classified as a probable carcinogen by 
      the International Agency for Research on Cancer. NDMA exposure to humans is 
      potentially vast, with reports of it occurring in tobacco products, food, water, 
      interior air of cars, toiletries, and a variety of other household goods. Public 
      attention has recently focused on NDMA contamination because it has been 
      implicated in the recall of several medications, including valsartan, losartan, 
      irbesartan, and, most recently, the removal of ranitidine from the market. Its 
      potential for elevated risk of cancer has sparked concern in the health care 
      community. Pharmacists are uniquely situated to process and use this complex 
      information because of their extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      knowledge of medications, direct and regular contact with patients, insights and 
      familiarity with recalls, and ability to discuss alternative medications that may 
      alleviate a patient's concerns. It is important to communicate the context and 
      clinical relevance of NDMA contamination to both patients and fellow health care 
      clinicians. Pharmacists can help balance the potential adverse effects of 
      switching medication and the concern related to NDMA in making an informed health 
      decision.

TI  - Angiotensin IV induces tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and 
      paxillin in proximal tubule cells.
PG  - F980-8
AB  - Angiotensin IV (ANG IV), the COOH-terminal hexapeptide fragment of angiotensin II 
      (ANG II), binds to specific sites in the kidney, distinct from type 1 (AT(1)) and 
      type 2 (AT(2)) receptors and designated type 4 (AT(4)) receptors. We determined 
      signaling pathways for ANG IV in a proximal tubular cell line, LLC-PK(1)/Cl(4). 
      In these cells, we found no specific binding of [(125)I]-ANG II. In contrast, ANG 
      IV dose dependently competed for [(125)I]-labeled ANG IV binding, with no 
      displacement by either ANG II, the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan, or the 
      AT(2) antagonist PD-123319. Saturation binding indicated the presence of AT(4) 
      receptors of high affinity [dissociation constant (K(d)) = 1.4 nM]. ANG IV did 
      not affect cAMP or cGMP production and did not increase cytosolic calcium 
      concentration in these cells. In contrast, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting 
      studies revealed that ANG IV caused dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of 
      p125-focal adhesion kinase (p125-FAK) and p68-paxillin within 2 min, with maximal 
      stimulation at 30 min. ANG IV-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125-FAK and 
      paxillin was not affected by pretreatment with either losartan or PD-123319, and 
      ANG II (10(-7) M) did not induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results 
      indicate that LLC-PK(1)/Cl(4) cells express ANG IV receptors, which we 
      demonstrate for the first time are linked to tyrosine phosphorylation of focal 
      adhesion-associated proteins. This suggests that ANG IV, a product of ANG II 
      metabolism, may regulate function of the focal adhesion complex in proximal 
      tubule cells.

TI  - Interactions between grapefruit juice and cardiovascular drugs.
PG  - 281-97
AB  - Grapefruit juice can alter oral drug pharmacokinetics by different mechanisms. 
      Irreversible inactivation of intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is produced by 
      commercial grapefruit juice given as a single normal amount (e.g. 200-300 mL) or 
      by whole fresh fruit segments. As a result, presystemic metabolism is reduced and 
      oral drug bioavailability increased. Enhanced oral drug bioavailability can occur 
      24 hours after juice consumption. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a 
      possible mechanism that increases oral drug bioavailability by reducing 
      intestinal and/or hepatic efflux transport. Recently, inhibition of organic anion 
      transporting polypeptides by grapefruit juice was observed in vitro; intestinal 
      uptake transport appeared decreased as oral drug bioavailability was reduced. 
      Numerous medications used in the prevention or treatment of coronary artery 
      disease and its complications have been observed or are predicted to interact 
      with grapefruit juice. Such interactions may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis 
      when dyslipidemia is treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin, 
      lovastatin, or simvastatin. Potential alternative agents are pravastatin, 
      fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin. Such interactions might also cause excessive 
      vasodilatation when hypertension is managed with the dihydropyridines felodipine, 
      nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine, or nitrendipine. An alternative agent could 
      be amlodipine. In contrast, the therapeutic effect of the angiotensin II type 1 
      receptor antagonist losartan may be reduced by grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice 
      interacting with the antidiabetic agent repaglinide may cause hypoglycemia, and 
      interaction with the appetite suppressant sibutramine may cause elevated BP and 
      HR. In angina pectoris, administration of grapefruit juice could result in 
      atrioventricular conduction disorders with verapamil or attenuated antiplatelet 
      activity with clopidrogel. Grapefruit juice may enhance drug toxicity for 
      antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, quinidine, disopyramide, or 
      propafenone, and for the congestive heart failure drug, carvediol. Some drugs for 
      the treatment of peripheral or central vascular disease also have the potential 
      to interact with grapefruit juice. Interaction with sildenafil, tadalafil, or 
      vardenafil for erectile dysfunction, may cause serious systemic vasodilatation 
      especially when combined with a nitrate. Interaction between ergotamine for 
      migraine and grapefruit juice may cause gangrene or stroke. In stroke, 
      interaction with nimodipine may cause systemic hypotension. If a drug has low 
      inherent oral bioavailability from presystemic metabolism by CYP3A4 or efflux 
      transport by P-gp and the potential to produce serious overdose toxicity, 
      avoidance of grapefruit juice entirely during pharmacotherapy appears mandatory. 
      Although altered drug response is variable among individuals, the outcome is 
      difficult to predict and avoiding the combination will guarantee toxicity is 
      prevented. The elderly are at particular risk, as they are often prescribed 
      medications and frequently consume grapefruit juice.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin II on sodium potassium pumps, endogenous ouabain, and 
      aldosterone in bovine zona glomerulosa cells.
PG  - 373-7
AB  - Angiotensin (Ang) II stimulates secretions of aldosterone and an endogenous 
      ouabain-like steroid (EO) from bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa (BAG) cells. The 
      BAG cell sodium pump, a possible target of EO, affects aldosterone secretion 
      although little is known about this pump. Here, we describe the effects of Ang II 
      on the characteristics of this transporter and steroid secretions. Under 
      serum-free conditions, 3H-ouabain bound to a single class of sites on BAG cells. 
      Binding of label was time and concentration dependent, was sensitive to 
      extracellular potassium ions, and was displaced by ouabain and digoxin with EC50 
      of approximately 218 and approximately 232 nmol/L, respectively. Sodium 
      pump-mediated 86Rb uptake was inhibited by ouabain (EC50 approximately 301 
      nmol/L). Ang II dose dependently augmented secretions of EO and aldosterone, 
      increased ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and 3H-ouabain binding, and increased the 
      affinity for 3H-ouabain binding (Kd, from 205 to 80 nmol/L) with no change in the 
      maximal number of sodium pumps (5.45x10(6)) per cell. Losartan blocked all 
      effects of Ang II except EO secretion, which was inhibited by PD123319. We 
      conclude that BAG cells express sodium pumps in high density and bind ouabain to 
      a single class of low-affinity sites. The characteristics of the sodium pumps 
      protect BAG cells from EO autotoxicity but may exclude them from mediating 
      feedback inhibition of EO secretion. The effects of Ang II on sodium pump 
      activity, ouabain binding affinity, and aldosterone secretion are mediated via 
      Ang II type 1 receptors, whereas Ang II type 2 receptors augment EO secretion. 
      The role of the Ang II-mediated increase in the ouabain sensitivity of BAG cell 
      sodium pumps in the secretions of aldosterone and EO remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Functional Investigation of Solute Carrier Family 35, Member F2, in Three 
      Cellular Models of the Primate Blood-Brain Barrier.
PG  - 3-11
LID - 10.1124/dmd.120.000115 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of drug transport across the blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB) is an important issue for regulating the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the 
      central nervous system. In this study, we focused on solute carrier family 35, 
      member F2 (SLC35F2), whose mRNA is highly expressed in the BBB. SLC35F2 protein 
      was enriched in isolated mouse and monkey brain capillaries relative to brain 
      homogenates and was localized exclusively on the apical membrane of MDCKII cells 
      and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) differentiated from human 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS-BMECs). SLC35F2 activity was assessed using 
      its substrate, YM155, and pharmacological experiments revealed SLC35F2 
      inhibitors, such as famotidine (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, 160 μM). 
      Uptake of YM155 was decreased by famotidine or SLC35F2 knockdown in immortalized 
      human BMECs (human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell/D3 cells). 
      Furthermore, famotidine significantly inhibited the apical (A)-to-basal (B) 
      transport of YM155 in primary cultured monkey BMECs and hiPS-BMECs. Crucially, 
      SLC35F2 knockout diminished the A-to-B transport and intracellular accumulation 
      of YM155 in hiPS-BMECs. By contrast, in studies using an in situ brain perfusion 
      technique, neither deletion of Slc35f2 nor famotidine reduced brain uptake of 
      YM155, even though YM155 is a substrate of mouse SLC35F2. YM155 uptake was 
      decreased significantly by losartan and naringin, inhibitors for the organic 
      anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1A4. These findings suggest SLC35F2 is a 
      functional transporter in various cellular models of the primate BBB that 
      delivers its substrates to the brain and that its relative importance in the BBB 
      is modified by differences in the expression of OATPs between primates and 
      rodents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrated that SLC35F2 is a 
      functional drug influx transporter in three different cellular models of the 
      primate blood-brain barrier (i.e., human cerebral microvascular endothelial 
      cell/D3 cells, primary cultured monkey BMECs, and human induced pluripotent 
      stem-BMECs) but has limited roles in mouse brain. SLC35F2 facilitates 
      apical-to-basal transport across the tight cell monolayer. These findings will 
      contribute to the development of improved strategies for targeting drugs to the 
      central nervous system.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading, highly 
      contagious, and sometimes fatal disease for which drug discovery and vaccine 
      development are critical. SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL(pro)) was used to 
      virtually screen 1697 clinical FDA-approved drugs. Among the top results expected 
      to bind with SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) strongly were three cell protectives and 
      antioxidants (NAD+, quercitrin, and oxiglutatione), three antivirals (ritonavir, 
      moroxydine, and zanamivir), two antimicrobials (doripenem and sulfaguanidine), 
      two anticancer drugs, three benzimidazole anthelmintics, one antacid 
      (famotidine), three anti-hypertensive ACE receptor blockers (candesartan, 
      losartan, and valsartan) and other miscellaneous systemically or topically acting 
      drugs. The binding patterns of these drugs were superior to the previously 
      identified SARS CoV PL(pro) inhibitor, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), suggesting a 
      potential for repurposing these drugs to treat COVID-19. The objective of drug 
      repurposing is the rapid relocation of safe and approved drugs by bypassing the 
      lengthy pharmacokinetic, toxicity, and preclinical phases. The ten drugs with the 
      highest estimated docking scores with favorable pharmacokinetics were subjected 
      to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular 
      mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations. 
      Phenformin, quercetin, and ritonavir all demonstrated prospective binding 
      affinities for COVID-19 PL(pro) over 50 ns MD simulations, with binding energy 
      values of -56.6, -40.9, and -37.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Energetic and 
      structural analyses showed phenformin was more stable than quercetin and 
      ritonavir. The list of the drugs provided herein constitutes a primer for 
      clinical application in COVID-19 patients and guidance for further antiviral 
      studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Androgens augment proximal tubule transport.
PG  - F452-9
AB  - The proximal tubule contains an autonomous renin-angiotensin system that 
      regulates transport independently of circulating angiotensin II. Androgens are 
      known to increase expression of angiotensinogen, but the effect of androgens on 
      proximal tubule transport is unknown. In this in vivo microperfusion study, we 
      examined the effect of androgens on proximal tubule transport. The volume 
      reabsorptive rate in Sprague-Dawley rats given dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 
      injections was significantly higher than in control rats given vehicle injections 
      (4.57 +/- 0.31 vs. 3.31 +/- 0.23 nl x min(-1) x mm(-1), P < 0.01). Luminally 
      perfusing with either enalaprilat (10(-4) M) to inhibit production of angiotensin 
      II or losartan (10(-8) M) to block the angiotensin receptor decreased the 
      proximal tubule volume reabsorptive rate in DHT-treated rats to a significantly 
      greater degree than in control vehicle-injected rats. The renal expression of 
      angiotensinogen was shown to be higher in the DHT-treated animals, using Northern 
      blot analysis. The expression of angiotensin receptors, determined by specific 
      binding of angiotensin II, was not different in the two groups of animals. 
      Brush-border membrane protein abundance of the Na/H exchanger, a membrane 
      transport protein under angiotensin II regulation, was also higher in DHT-treated 
      rats vs. control rats. Rats that received DHT had higher blood pressures than the 
      control rats but had no change in their glomerular filtration rate. In addition, 
      serum angiotensin II levels were lower in DHT-treated vs. control rats. These 
      results suggest that androgens may directly upregulate the proximal tubule 
      renin-angiotensin system, increase the volume reabsorptive rate, and thereby 
      increase extracellular volume and blood pressure and secondarily decrease serum 
      angiotensin II levels.

TI  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers for the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 1795-804
AB  - The rising incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF) and end stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) has signalled a need to increase awareness, treatment and 
      control of hypertension. There continues to be a need for effective 
      antihypertensive medications since hypertension is a major precursor to various 
      forms of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin (AT) aldosterone system 
      (RAAS) is a key component to the development of hypertension and can be one 
      target of drug therapy. Angotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers (ARBs) are the 
      most recent class of agents available to treat hypertension, which work by by 
      inhibiting ATII at the receptor level. Currently, national consensus guidelines 
      recommend that ARBs should be reserved for hypertensive patients who cannot 
      tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). ARBs, however, 
      are moving to the forefront of therapy with a promising role in the area of 
      renoprotection and CHF. Recent trials such as the The Renoprotective Effect of 
      the Angiotensin-Receptor Antagonist Irbesartan in Patients with Nephropathy Due 
      to Type 2 Diabetes Trial (IDNT), the Effect of Irbesartan on the Development of 
      Diabetic Nephropathy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (IRMA2), and The Effects of 
      Losartan on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
      and Nephropathy (RENAAL) study have demonstrated the renoprotective effects of 
      ARBs in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial 
      (Val-HeFT) adds to the growing body of evidence that ARBs may improve morbidity 
      and mortality in CHF patients. As a class, ARBs are well tolerated and have a 
      lower incidence of cough and angioedema compared to ACEIs. This article reviews 
      the differences among the ARBs, existing efficacy data in hypertension, and 
      explores the role of ARBs in CHF and renal disease.

TI  - Pharmacology of CS-866, a novel nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
PG  - 181-8
AB  - CS-866, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methoxy-4-(1-hydroxy-1- 
      methylethyl)-2-propyl-1-(4-[2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-phenyl]phenyl)met hylimidazol- 
      5-carboxylate, a prodrug type angiotensin receptor antagonist, is deesterified to 
      the active acid, RNH-6270. RNH-6270 inhibited [125I]angiotensin II binding to 
      bovine adrenal cortical membranes (angiotensin AT1 receptors) with an IC50 value 
      of 7.7 nM, but not [125I]angiotensin II binding to bovine cerebellar membranes 
      (angiotensin AT2 receptors), indicating the selectivity of the compound for 
      angiotensin AT1 receptors. In guinea pig aortas, RNH-6270 reduced the maximal 
      response of the concentration-contractile curve for angiotensin II (pD'2 = 9.9), 
      but had no effect on the contractile response induced by phenylephrine or KCl. In 
      conscious rats, intravenously injected RNH-6270 inhibited angiotensin II-induced 
      pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner, and orally administered CS-866 
      produced a long-lasting inhibition of angiotensin II pressor responses. 
      SK&F-525A, a P-450 inhibitor, suppressed the angiotensin II inhibitory effect of 
      losartan, but not that of CS-866. These results demonstrate that RNH-6270 is a 
      potent and AT1-selective angiotensin receptor antagonist and that, after oral 
      administration, CS-866 has a long-lasting angiotensin II inhibitory action which 
      is not affected by drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver.

TI  - Effects of repeated green tea catechin administration on human cytochrome P450 
      activity.
PG  - 2473-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Preclinical studies suggested that green tea or green tea catechins can 
      modulate the activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes. We conducted this clinical 
      study to determine the effect of repeated green tea catechin administration on 
      human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities. METHODS: Forty-two healthy 
      volunteers underwent a 4-week washout period by refraining from tea or 
      tea-related products. At the end of the washout period, study participants 
      received a cocktail of CYP metabolic probe drugs, including caffeine, 
      dextromethorphan, losartan, and buspirone for assessing the activity of CYP1A2, 
      CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, respectively. Blood and urine samples before and 8 h 
      after probe drug administration were collected to determine parent drug and 
      metabolite concentrations for measurements of baseline CYP enzyme activities. 
      Following the baseline evaluation, study participants underwent 4 weeks of green 
      tea catechin intervention at a dose that contains 800 mg epigallocatechin gallate 
      (EGCG) daily. The green tea catechin product was taken on an empty stomach to 
      optimize the p.o. bioavailability of EGCG. The EGCG dose given in this study 
      exceeded the amounts provided by average green tea consumption. Upon completion 
      of the green tea catechin intervention, the postintervention CYP enzyme 
      activities were evaluated as described above. RESULTS: There are large 
      between-subject variations in CYP enzyme activities in healthy individuals. Four 
      weeks of green tea catechin intervention did not alter the phenotypic indices of 
      CYP1A2, CYP12D6, and CYP12C9, but resulted in a 20% increase (P = 0.01) in the 
      area under the plasma buspirone concentration-time profile, suggesting a small 
      reduction in CYP3A4 activity. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that repeated green tea 
      catechin administration is not likely to result in clinically significant effects 
      on the disposition of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.

TI  - Interactions between antiretroviral drugs and drugs used for the therapy of the 
      metabolic complications encountered during HIV infection.
PG  - 1195-211
AB  - Treatment of HIV infection with potent combination antiretroviral therapy has 
      resulted in major improvement in overall survival, immune function and the 
      incidence of opportunistic infections. However, HIV infection and treatment has 
      been associated with the development of metabolic complications, including 
      hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, lipodystrophy and osteopenia. 
      Safe pharmacological treatment of these complications requires an understanding 
      of the drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and the drugs used in 
      the treatment of metabolic complications. Since formal studies of most of these 
      interactions have not been performed, predictions must be based on our 
      understanding of the metabolism of these agents. All HIV protease inhibitors are 
      metabolised by and inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Ritonavir is the most 
      potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Ritonavir and nelfinavir also induce a host of CYP 
      isoforms as well as some conjugating enzymes. The non-nucleoside reverse 
      transcriptase inhibitor delavirdine potently inhibits CYP3A4, whereas nevirapine 
      and efavirenz are inducers of CYP3A4. Drug interaction studies have been 
      performed with HIV protease inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 
      Coadministration of ritonavir plus saquinavir to HIV-seronegative volunteers 
      resulted in increased exposure to simvastatin acid by 3059%. Atorvastatin 
      exposure increased by 347%, but exposure to active atorvastatin increased by only 
      79%. Conversely, pravastatin exposure decreased by 50%. Similar results have been 
      obtained with combinations of simvastatin and atorvastatin with other HIV 
      protease inhibitors. Thus, the lactone prodrugs simvastatin and lovastatin should 
      not be used with HIV protease inhibitors. Atorvastatin may be used with caution. 
      Although there are no formal studies available, calcium channel antagonists and 
      repaglinide may have significant interactions and toxicity when used with HIV 
      protease inhibitors because of their metabolism by CYP3A4. Sulfonylurea drugs 
      utilise mainly CYP2C9 for metabolism, and this isoenzyme may be induced by 
      ritonavir and nelfinavir with a resulting decrease in efficacy of the 
      sulfonylurea. Losartan may have increased effect when coadministered with 
      ritonavir and nelfinavir because of the induction of CYP2C9 and the expected 
      increase in formation of the active metabolite, E-3174. Overall, well-designed 
      drug-drug interaction studies at steady state are needed to determine whether 
      antiretroviral drugs may be safely coadministered with many of the drugs used in 
      the treatment of the metabolic complications of HIV infection.

TI  - The expression of renin and the formation of angiotensin II in bovine aortic 
      endothelial cells.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - One controversy in the field of vascular angiotensin generation has surrounded 
      the nature and particularly the source of vascular renin. This study investigated 
      the expression of renin protein and its mRNA in aortic endothelial cells using 
      immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, in situ hybridization and reverse 
      transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using a monoclonal antibody against human renin, 
      immunocytochemical analysis revealed positive immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm 
      of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Immunoblotting of solubilized 
      proteins separated by SDS-PAGE from cultured aortic endothelial cells identified 
      two immunoreactive species with molecular masses of approximately 37-40 kDa. In 
      situ hybridization showed that renin mRNA was localized in the cytoplasm of these 
      cells. Using RT-PCR of RNA extracted from bovine aortic endothelial cells with 
      primers specific for human renin, a clear single band was detected, which had the 
      predicted size of 142 bp for (pro)renin. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was assayed in 
      conditioned medium (CM) from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, and in 
      addition, the effects of Ang II and CM on the proliferation of aorta smooth 
      muscle cells (ASMC) were also studied. The results showed that CM contained Ang 
      II equivalent to 15.05+/-4.67 pg/10(6) cells. Assay of smooth muscle cell 
      proliferation by cell number, and by tritiated thymidine uptake, showed that 
      proliferative responses in the presence of Ang II at a concentration of 10(-6)M 
      were evident within 1 day of subculture, and cell numbers were nearly twice those 
      of controls after 2 days. Thymidine incorporation into ASMC was also increased by 
      Ang II in a dose-dependent manner and by endothelial cell CM. In both cases, 
      stimulated proliferation was inhibited by the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor 
      selective antagonist, losartan. These findings suggest that these vascular 
      endothelial cells are a source of locally synthesized renin that may thus be 
      involved in vascular Ang II generation. They also suggest that Ang II produced by 
      the endothelial cells may be secreted and stimulate ASMC proliferation via the 
      AT1 receptor.

TI  - A possible link between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in 
      hypertension. A LIFE substudy. Losartan Intervention For Endpoint-Reduction in 
      Hypertension.
PG  - 132-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We wanted to investigate whether insulin resistance and time to 
      steady state during isoglycemic clamp were associated with endothelial 
      dysfunction, peripheral vascular remodeling and forearm blood flow (FBF) in 
      patients with longstanding hypertension. METHODS: In 43 unmedicated, hypertensive 
      patients with electrocardiographic-defined left ventricular hypertrophy we 
      performed a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test and a 3-h isoglycemic 
      hyperinsulinemic clamp with measurements of circulating plasma epinephrine and 
      FBF by plethysmography. Delayed steady state was assessed by measuring the 
      increase in insulin sensitivity from the second to the third hour of clamping. We 
      measured 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, minimal forearm vascular resistance 
      (MFVR) by plethysmography, media:lumen ratio (MLR) and acetylcholine-induced 
      relaxation (AIR) in isolated, subcutaneous resistance arteries by myography. 
      RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity after 2 and 3 h of clamping was not related to 
      maximal AIR, MLR, MFVR or FBF. The increase in insulin sensitivity in men was 
      negatively correlated to maximal AIR (r = -0.36, p < 0.05), and was independently 
      correlated to relative changes in FBF (beta = 0.46) and in circulating 
      epinephrine (beta = 0.33; adj. R = 0.33, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin 
      sensitivity was not correlated to parameters of peripheral vascular remodeling, 
      endothelial function or microvascular rarefaction in patients with longstanding 
      hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. However, the action of insulin on 
      peripheral glucose uptake was influenced by endothelial dysfunction (delayed 
      transcapillary insulin transport) and by changes in and/or redistribution of 
      blood flow suggesting a link between vascular function and insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Short- and long-term effects of body weight, calorie restriction and gastric 
      bypass on CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 activity.
PG  - 4121-4133
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15349 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may influence drug disposition due to 
      surgery-induced gastrointestinal alterations and/or subsequent weight loss. The 
      objective was to compare short- and long-term effects of RYGB and diet on the 
      metabolic ratios of paraxanthine/caffeine (cytochrome P450 [CYP] 1A2 activity), 
      5-hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole (CYP2C19 activity) and losartan/losartan 
      carboxylic acid (CYP2C9 activity), and cross-sectionally compare these 
      CYP-activities with normal-to-overweight controls. METHODS: This trial included 
      patients with severe obesity preparing for RYGB (n = 40) or diet-induced (n = 41) 
      weight loss, and controls (n = 18). Both weight loss groups underwent a 3-week 
      low-energy diet (<1200 kcal/day, weeks 0-3) followed by a 6-week very-low-energy 
      diet or RYGB (both <800 kcal/day, weeks 3-9). Follow-up time was 2 years, with 
      four pharmacokinetic investigations. RESULTS: Mean ± SD weight loss from baseline 
      was similar in the RYGB-group (13 ± 2.4%) and the diet group (10.5 ± 3.9%) at 
      week 9, but differed at year 2 (RYGB -30 ± 6.9%, diet -3.1 ± 6.3%). From weeks 0 
      to 3, mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) CYP2C19 activity similarly increased in 
      both groups (RYGB 43% [16, 55], diet 48% [22, 60]). Mean CYP2C19 activity 
      increased by 30% (2.6, 43) after RYGB (weeks 3-9), but not in the diet-group 
      (between-group difference -0.30 [-0.63, 0.03]). CYP2C19 activity remained 
      elevated in the RYGB group at year 2. Baseline CYP2C19 activity was 2.7-fold 
      higher in controls compared with patients with obesity, whereas no difference was 
      observed in CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activities. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that 
      CYP2C19 activity is lower in patients with obesity and increases following weight 
      loss. This may be clinically relevant for drug dosing. No clinically significant 
      effect on CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activities was observed.

TI  - Significance of angiotensin type 1 receptor blockade: why are angiotensin II 
      receptor blockers different?
PG  - 9S-15S
AB  - The angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are safe and effective agents in the 
      treatment of hypertension, and they have potential in treating other 
      cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure. These drugs share a common 
      mechanism of action: They selectively block the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) 
      receptor. A new ARB, candesartan cilexetil is a prodrug that is converted 
      completely into the active metabolite candesartan during gastrointestinal 
      absorption, whereas losartan is converted partially by hepatic metabolism into 
      the more active compound EXP 3174. Valsartan and irbesartan are active in their 
      own right. These ARBs differ pharmacologically in terms of their affinity for the 
      AT1 receptor, the mechanism by which they block the receptor, and the duration of 
      their receptor-blocking activity. In radioligand-binding studies, candesartan had 
      a slightly higher affinity for the AT1 receptor than the other ARBs. In the 
      rabbit aorta, candesartan blocked angiotensin II-induced contractions in an 
      insurmountable manner, whereas losartan blocked the contractions competitively, 
      and EXP 3174, valsortan and irbesartan blocked the contractions in a manner 
      intermediate between competitive and insurmountable antagonism. The 
      insurmountable antagonism exhibited by candesartan likely reflects its 
      long-lasting blockade of the AT1 receptor due to a slow dissociation rate. This 
      suggests that candesartan will exhibit a longer duration of action than would be 
      predicted simply from its pharmacokinetic elimination half-life. Comparative 
      clinical trials with several ARBs are needed to define the clinical significance 
      of these pharmacologic differences.

TI  - Effect of Red Ginseng on cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein activities in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 375-381
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the drug interaction profile of Red Ginseng (RG) with 
      respect to the activities of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and the drug 
      transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in healthy Korean volunteers. METHODS: This 
      article describes an open-label, crossover study. CYP probe cocktail drugs, 
      caffeine, losartan, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, midazolam, and fexofenadine 
      were administered before and after RG supplementation for 2 wk. Plasma samples 
      were collected, and tolerability was assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      calculated, and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of 
      the parameters were determined from logarithmically transformed data using 
      analysis of variance after RG administration versus before RG administration. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen healthy male participants were evaluated, none of whom were 
      genetically defined as poor CYP2C9, 2C19, and CYP2D6 metabolizers based on 
      genotyping. Before and after RG administration, the geometric least-square mean 
      metabolic ratio (90% CI) was 0.870 (0.805-0.940) for caffeine to paraxanthine 
      (CYP1A2), 0.871 (0.800-0.947) for losartan (CYP2C9) to EXP3174, 1.027 
      (0.938-1.123) for omeprazole (CYP2C19) to 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 1.373 
      (0.864-2.180) for dextromethorphan to dextrorphan (CYP2D6), and 0.824 
      (0.658-1.032) for midazolam (CYP3A4) to 1-hydroxymidazolam. The geometric mean 
      ratio of the area under the curve of the last sampling time (AUC(last)) for 
      fexofenadine (P-gp) was 0.963 (0.845-1.098). Administration of concentrated RG 
      for 2 wk weakly inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and weakly induced CYP2D6. However, 
      no clinically significant drug interactions were observed between RG and CYP and 
      P-gp probe substrates. CONCLUSION: RG has no relevant potential to cause CYP 
      enzyme- or P-gp-related interactions. Clinical trial registration number 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT02056743.

TI  - Identification and Functional Assessment of a New CYP2C9 Allelic Variant 
      CYP2C9*59.
PG  - 1246-9
LID - 10.1124/dmd.115.063412 [doi]
AB  - CYP2C9, one of the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes, is responsible for 
      metabolizing approximately 15% of clinically important drugs, including warfarin, 
      diclofenac, and losartan. Similar to other CYP members, human CYP2C9 exhibits 
      marked genetic polymorphisms among individuals of different ethnicities. In this 
      study, a novel missense mutation (1300A>T) was identified in a warfarin-sensitive 
      patient after a genetic screen of three candidate genes related to high 
      variability in response to warfarin doses. This base transversion leads to an 
      Ile-to-Phe amino acid substitution at codon 434 within the CYP2C9 protein, and 
      this new variant has been named a novel allele, CYP2C9*59, by the Human CYP 
      Allele Nomenclature Committee (http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2c9.htm). The 
      exogenous expression of CYP2C9.59 in insect cell microsomes revealed that, 
      despite a similar protein expression level as wild-type CYP2C9, variant CYP2C9.59 
      exhibited significantly reduced maximal velocity, Vmax, and/or increased 
      Michaelis constant, Km, values toward three CYP2C9-specific substrates. Our data 
      suggest that the 1300A>T mutation can greatly decrease the enzymatic activity of 
      the CYP2C9 protein both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Cisplatin (CDDP; cis-diamine dichloroplatinum)-induced nephrotoxicity is the main 
      reason for dose limitations, which can reduce the efficacy of cancer treatment. 
      Lower blood pressure and administration of renin angiotensin system (RAS) 
      inhibitors have been reported as factors that exacerbate CDDP-induced 
      nephrotoxicity; however, the detailed mechanisms remain unknown and the results 
      of previous studies are conflicting. In this study, we examined the influence of 
      various hypotensive drugs, including RAS inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, 
      on CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity in BALB/c mice. The mice were divided into nine 
      groups: (1) CDDP group (15 mg/kg CDDP), (2) AML group (5 mg/kg amlodipine), (3) 
      ENA group (2.5 mg/kg enalapril), (4) telmisartan (TEL) group (10 mg/kg 
      telmisartan), (5) LOS group (10 mg/kg losartan), (6) CDDP + AML group, (7) 
      CDDP + ENA group, (8) CDDP + TEL group, and (9) CDDP + LOS group. Nephrotoxicity 
      was evaluated by measuring serum creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
      levels. In addition, the kidney sections were stained with Masson's trichrome and 
      terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end 
      labeling (TUNEL) to assess the renal fibrosis area and apoptotic area. Serum CRE 
      and BUN levels were increased in the CDDP + ENA, CDDP + LOS, and CDDP + TEL 
      groups compared to those in the CDDP alone group, and the CDDP + AML group showed 
      an increasing trend. However, there was no correlation between ∆CRE or ∆BUN 
      levels and ∆ systolic blood pressure. The CDDP + TEL group showed a significant 
      increase in the renal fibrosis area. These results suggest that exacerbation of 
      CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity is not correlated with systolic blood pressure but is 
      associated with administration of RAS inhibitors, particularly TEL.

TI  - Endothelium-derived steroidogenic factor enhances angiotensin II-stimulated 
      aldosterone release by bovine zona glomerulosa cells.
PG  - 317-23
AB  - Endothelium-derived steroidogenic factor (EDSF) is an endothelial peptide that 
      stimulates aldosterone release from bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells. 
      The regulation of aldosterone release by combinations of EDSF and angiotensin II 
      (AII) or EDSF and ACTH was investigated. Endothelial cells (ECs) and 
      EC-conditioned media (ECCM) increased aldosterone release from ZG cells, an 
      activity attributed to EDSF. AII (10(-12) to 10(-8) M) and ACTH (10(-12) to 
      10(-9) M) also stimulated the release of aldosterone from ZG cells. The 
      stimulation by AII, but not ACTH, was greatly enhanced when ZG cells were 
      coincubated with ECs. AII was metabolized by ECs to peptides identified by mass 
      spectrometry as angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin IV. There was very little 
      metabolism of AII by ZG cells. Neither of these two AII metabolites altered 
      aldosterone release from ZG cells, so they could not account for the enhanced 
      response with ECs. AII-induced aldosterone release from ZG cells was enhanced by 
      ECCM but not cell-free conditioned medium. This enhanced response was not due to 
      increased EDSF release from ECs by AII. The synergistic effect of EDSF and AII 
      was apparent when AII was added during or after the generation of ECCM and not 
      observed when the AII component of the enhancement was blocked by the AII 
      antagonist, losartan. These studies indicate that EDSF enhances the steroidogenic 
      effect of AII. In the adrenal gland, ECs are in close anatomical relationship 
      with ZG cells and may sensitize ZG cells to the steroidogenic action of AII by 
      releasing EDSF.

TI  - Identification and characterization of the new generation soluble guanylate 
      cyclase stimulator BAY-747 designed for the treatment of resistant hypertension.
PG  - 2500-2513
LID - 10.1111/bph.16142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: First-generation soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) 
      stimulators have shown clinical benefit in pulmonary hypertension (riociguat) and 
      chronic heart failure (vericiguat). However, given the broad therapeutic 
      opportunities for sGC stimulators, tailored molecules for distinct indications 
      are required. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We report the high-throughput screening 
      (HTS)-based discovery of a second generation of sGC stimulators from a novel 
      imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine lead series. An intense medicinal chemistry programme 
      resulted in the discovery of the sGC stimulator BAY 1165747 (BAY-747). The 
      pharmacokinetic profile of BAY-747 was determined in different species, and it 
      was broadly characterized in pharmacological model systems relevant for 
      vasodilatation and hypertension. KEY RESULTS: BAY-747 is a highly potent sGC 
      stimulator in vitro. In addition, BAY-747 showed an excellent pharmacokinetic 
      profile with long half-life and low peak-to-trough ratio. BAY-747 was 
      investigated in experimental in vivo models of malignant and resistant 
      hypertension (rHT). In spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, BAY-747 caused a 
      dose-related and long-lasting decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). 
      Oral treatment over 12 days resulted in a persistent decrease. BAY-747 provided 
      additional benefit when dosed on top of losartan, amlodipine or spironolactone 
      and even on top of triple combinations of frequently used antihypertensive drugs. 
      In a new canine model of rHT, BAY-747 caused a dose-related and long-lasting 
      (>6 h) MAP decrease. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: BAY-747 is a potent, orally 
      available sGC stimulator. BAY-747 shows long-acting pharmacodynamic effects with 
      a very low peak-to-trough ratio. BAY-747 could be a treatment alternative for 
      patients with hypertension, especially those not responding to standard-of-care 
      therapy.

TI  - Two selective HPTLC methods for determination of some angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonists in tablets and biological fluids.
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3916 [doi]
AB  - Two simple, selective, precise and highly sensitive high-performance thin-layer 
      chromatography (HPTLC) methods have been developed and validated for analysis of 
      five angiotensin II receptor antagonists, namely losartan, irbesartan valsartan, 
      candesartan and olmesartan, which are widely used in clinical practice. HPTLC of 
      the drugs was performed on pre-coated silica gel HPTLC plates 60 F(254) by 
      development using a mobile phase composed of chloroform-acetone-glacial acetic 
      acid (7.8:1.5:0.7m v/v/v), which was suitable for all of the studied drugs. The 
      first method depended on utilizing reflectance/fluorescence mode for detection 
      while the second method depended on using 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone as 
      spraying reagent for the first time to form orange spots scanned at 460 nm. A 
      good linear relationship was obtained over the concentration ranges of 1.2-60 and 
      360-3000 ng/band while detection and quantification limits were in the ranges of 
      0.07-0.43, 45.2-140.49 and 0.21-1.29, 137.05-425.74 ng/band for 
      reflectance/fluorescence and reflectance/absorbance methods respectively. The 
      developed methods were applied successfully for their determination in tablets 
      and spiked human plasma for reflectance/fluorescence method with good accuracy 
      and precision, and so can be applied in the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability 
      studies.

TI  - Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide association in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 120-36
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important and common vascular risk factors 
      but it is often poorly controlled. Inhibition of the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) provides beneficial effects in 
      hypertensives. The association of low-dosed diuretics in combination with RAAS 
      blocking agents allows maximum benefit from potassium depletion and control of 
      compensatory increase in renin secretion, so increasing the efficacy and safety 
      of RAAS blockers. Irbesartan is a potent and selective angiotensin II subtype 1 
      receptor antagonist indicated for use in patients with hypertension, including 
      those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Once-daily irbesartan 
      administration provides 24h control of BP. In patients with mild-to-moderate 
      hypertension, irbesartan was as effective as enalapril, atenolol and amlodipine, 
      and more effective than losartan and valsartan in terms of absolute reduction in 
      BP and response rate. Irbesartan also induced regression of left ventricular 
      hypertrophy. Moreover, irbesartan 300 mg/day exerts a significant renoprotective 
      effect in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. The relative risk of doubling of 
      serum creatinine was significantly lower with irbesartan than amlodipine or 
      placebo. Irbesartan was also effective in non-diabetic nephropatic patients. 
      Moreover, irbesartan has peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonistic 
      effects in in vitro studies, and it also demonstrated beneficial effects on 
      inflammatory markers of atherosclerosis and endothelial function. The overall 
      incidence of adverse events is similar to that of placebo. A fixed dose of 
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and irbesartan shows additive antihypertensive effect 
      in a dose dependent manner up to HCTZ 25 mg and irbesartan 300 mg with high 
      tolerability in diverse patient groups. Combination effects on end organ 
      protection must be evaluated by broad spectrum studies. Ongoing trials about 
      irbesartan and its combination with diuretics may provide necessary data to 
      interpret the value of this association among others.

TI  - Protection of the cardiovascular system by imidapril, a versatile 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
PG  - 93-110
AB  - Imidapril hydrochloride (imidapril) is a long-acting, non-sulfhydryl 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which has been used clinically in 
      the treatment of hypertension, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI), and diabetic nephropathy. It has the unique 
      advantage over other ACE inhibitors in causing a lower incidence of dry cough. 
      After oral administration, imidapril is rapidly converted in the liver to its 
      active metabolite imidaprilat. The plasma levels of imidaprilat gradually 
      increase in proportion to the dose, and decline slowly. The time to reach the 
      maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) is 2.0 h for imidapril and 9.3 h for 
      imidaprilat. The elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) of imidapril and imidaprilat is 
      1.7 and 14.8 h, respectively. Imidapril and its metabolites are excreted chiefly 
      in the urine. As an ACE inhibitor, imidaprilat is as potent as enalaprilat, an 
      active metabolite of enalapril, and about twice as potent as captopril. In 
      patients with hypertension, blood pressure was still decreased at 24 h after 
      imidapril administration. The antihypertensive effect of imidapril was 
      dose-dependent. The maximal reduction of blood pressure and plasma ACE was 
      achieved with imidapril, 10 mg once daily, and the additional effect was not 
      prominent with higher doses. When administered to patients with AMI, imidapril 
      improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced plasma brain natriuretic 
      peptide (BNP) levels. In patients with mild-to-moderate CHF [New York Heart 
      Association (NYHA) functional class II-III], imidapril increased exercise time 
      and physical working capacity and decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide 
      (ANP) and BNP levels in a dose-related manner. In patients with diabetic 
      nephropathy, imidapril decreased urinary albumin excretion. Interestingly, 
      imidapril improved asymptomatic dysphagia in patients with a history of stroke. 
      In the same patients it increased serum substance P levels, while the angiotensin 
      II receptor antagonist losartan was ineffective. These studies indicate that 
      imidapril is a versatile ACE inhibitor. In addition to its effectiveness in the 
      treatment of hypertension, CHF, and AMI, imidapril has beneficial effects in the 
      treatment of diabetic nephropathy and asymptomatic dysphagia. Good tissue 
      penetration and inhibition of tissue ACE by imidapril contributes to its 
      effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. The 
      major advantages of imidapril are its activity in the treatment of various 
      cardiovascular diseases and lower incidence of cough compared with some of the 
      older ACE inhibitors.

TI  - Clinical and hormonal effects of the new angiotensin II receptor antagonist 
      LRB081.
PG  - 252-8
AB  - The renin-angiotensin system is a major contributor to the pathophysiology of 
      cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and hypertension. 
      Antagonizing angiotensin (Ang) II at the receptor site may produce fewer side 
      effects than inhibition of the promiscuous converting enzyme. The present study 
      was designed to assess in healthy human subjects the effect of LRB081, a new 
      orally active AT1-receptor antagonist, on the pressor action of exogenous Ang II. 
      At the same time, plasma hormones and drug levels were monitored. At 1-week 
      intervals and in a double-blind randomized fashion, 8 male volunteers received 
      three doses of LRB081 (10, 40, and 80 mg) and placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was 
      measured at a finger by photoplethysmograph. The peak BP response to intravenous 
      injection of a standard dose of Ang II was determined before and for < or = 24 h 
      after administration of an oral dose of LRB081 or placebo. After drug 
      administration, the blood BP response to Ang II was expressed in percent of the 
      response before drug administration. At the same time, plasma renin activity 
      (PRA), Ang II, aldosterone, catecholamine (radioassays), and drug levels (by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography) were monitored. After LRB081 
      administration, a dose dependent inhibition of the BP response to Ang II was 
      observed. Maximal inhibition of the systolic BP response was 54 +/- 3 (mean +/- 
      SEM), 63 +/- 2, and 93 +/- 1% with 10, 40, and 80 mg LRB081, respectively. The 
      time to peak was 3 h for 6 subjects and 4 and 6 h for 2 others. Preliminary 
      plasma half-life (t1/2) was calculated at 2 h. With the highest dose, the 
      inhibition remained significant for 24 h (31 +/- 5%, p < 0.05). Maximal 
      BP-blocking effect and maximal plasma drug level coincided, suggesting that the 
      unmetabolized LRB081 is responsible for the antagonistic effect. PRA and Ang II 
      increased dose dependently after LRB081 intake. Aldosterone, epinephrine, and 
      norepinephrine concentrations remained unchanged. No clinically significant 
      adverse reaction was observed during the study. LRB081 is a well-tolerated, 
      orally active, potent, and long-acting Ang II receptor antagonist. Unlike in the 
      case of losartan, no active metabolite of LRB081 has been shown to be responsible 
      for the main effects.

TI  - Left ventricular hypertrophy and angiotensin II receptor blocking agents.
PG  - 61-7
AB  - Angiotensin II plays a significant role in cell growth and proliferation in model 
      systems and in humans. Numerous studies have shown that left ventricular 
      hypertrophy (LVH) increases the risk of coronary heart disease, congestive heart 
      failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack; all-cause deaths, and sudden death. 
      The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin 
      receptor blockers (ARBs) has provided beneficial effects on LVH regression and on 
      cardiac remodeling in the presence of hypertension and heart failure. The new 
      class of ARBs appears to provide cardioprotective effects that are similar to 
      those of the ACE inhibitors. Most of the beneficial effects provided by these 
      agents appear to be related to a more complete blockade of the angiotensin II 
      type 1 (AT1) receptor. However, costimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) 
      receptor appears to increase nitric oxide and thus causes some bradykinin-like 
      effects. Evidence for the role of angiotensin II in promoting LVH as well as 
      abnormal regulation of the angiotensin II signal transduction pathways in model 
      systems and in humans has been reviewed. Secondly, the mechanisms for the 
      beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers studied in model systems 
      and in humans, including possible involvement in the formation of reactive oxygen 
      species by mononuclear cells, are presented. Finally, results from large-scale 
      interventions such as the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) 
      study, as well as an overview of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use 
      Evaluation (VALUE) trial involving the use of ARB in high-risk patients, are 
      presented.

      bicyclic systems.

AB  - Novel AT 1 receptor antagonists bearing the pyrazolo[3,4- b]pyridine bicyclic 
      heteroaromatic system (or structurally related moieties) were designed and 
      synthesized as the final step of a large program devoted to the development of 
      new antihypertensive agents and to the understanding of the molecular basis of 
      their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. The preliminary 
      pharmacological characterization revealed nanomolar AT 1 receptor affinity for 
      several compounds of the series and a potent antagonistic activity in isolated 
      rabbit aortic strip functional assay for 7c and 8a. These results stimulated the 
      study of the biopharmaceutical properties of some selected compounds, which were 
      found to be characterized by a permeability from medium to high. Remarkably, the 
      least permeable 7c showed both permeability and oral bioavailability (80%) higher 
      than losartan, but its terminal half-life was shorter. These results suggest that 
      the permeability is not a limiting factor in the pharmacokinetics of these AT 1 
      receptor antagonists.

TI  - Determination of asperosaponin VI in rat plasma by HPLC-ESI-MS and its 
      application to preliminary pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 550-5
LID - 10.1002/bmc.1325 [doi]
AB  - Asperosaponin VI (also named akebia saponin D) is a typical bioactive 
      triterpenoid saponin isolated from the rhizome of Dipsacus asper Wall 
      (Dipsacaceae). In this work, a sensitive high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) assay has 
      been established for determination of asperosaponin VI in rat plasma. With 
      losartan as the internal standard (IS), plasma samples were prepared by protein 
      precipitation with methanol. Chromatographic separation was performed on a C(18) 
      column with a mobile phase of 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer containing 0.05% 
      formic acid-methanol (32 : 68, v/v). The analysis was performed on an ESI in the 
      selected ion monitoring mode using target ions at m/z 951.4 for asperosaponin VI 
      and m/z 423.2 for the IS. The calibration curve was linear over the range 3-1000 
      ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 3.0 ng/mL. The intra- and 
      inter-assay variability values were less than 9.5 and 7.8%, respectively. The 
      accuracies determined at the concentrations of 3.0, 100.0, 300.0 and 1000 ng/mL 
      for asperosaponin VI were within +/-15.0%. The validated method was successfully 
      applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats after oral administration of 
      asperosaponin VI.

TI  - Direct inhibition of renin as a cardiovascular pharmacotherapy: focus on 
      aliskiren.
PG  - 242-56
AB  - The important role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in the 
      treatment of systemic hypertension, heart failure, diabetic kidney disease, and 
      atherogenesis has been clearly established. The theoretical therapeutic 
      advantages for inhibiting the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system 
      at its most upstream point have served as the impetus for the development of 
      renin inhibitors. The advent of aliskiren, the first in a novel class of orally 
      active, nonpeptide, highly specific, human renin inhibitors, provides a new 
      modality in the armamentarium of renin-angiotensin system antagonists. Studies in 
      marmosets and rats demonstrated that aliskiren reduced blood pressure in a 
      dose-dependent manner and is highly efficacious in blocking plasma renin activity 
      with parallel reductions in the levels of the other downstream constituents of 
      the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients have 
      confirmed these benefits with aliskiren whose blood pressure-lowering efficacy is 
      similar to or better than those of standard therapeutic doses of enalapril, 
      losartan, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with 
      few reported adverse effects even at the highest doses tested. Given the 
      established beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 
      angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular and renovascular 
      diseases, future studies may further elucidate a similar protective role for 
      aliskiren both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy.

AB  - Olmesartan is an angiotensin receptor blockers with actions similar to those of 
      losartan; it is used for the treatment of high blood pressure by relaxing blood 
      vessels for this reason blood can flow more easily. It could be used alone or in 
      combination with other antihypertensive drugs. This chapter gives a comprehensive 
      profile of olmesartan, containing detailed nomenclature, formulae, elemental 
      analysis, and appearance of the drug. In addition this chapter also describes 
      several methods of synthesis and usage of the olmesartan. The profile covers the 
      physicochemical properties including pK(a) value, solubility, X-ray powder 
      diffraction, melting point, and procedures of analysis (compendial, 
      spectroscopic, electrochemical, and chromatographic techniques of analysis). 
      Comprehensive pharmacology is also presented (pharmacological actions, 
      therapeutic uses and dosing, interactions, and adverse effects and precautions). 
      Eighty references were given as a proof of the above-mentioned studies.

AB  - Novel angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) blockers bearing 6-substituted 
      carbamoyl benzimidazoles with a chiral center were designed and synthesized as 
      the first step to develop new antihypertensive agents and understand their 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. The newly synthesized compounds 
      were tested for their potential ability to displace [(125)I] Sar(1) Ile(8)-Ang 
      II, which was specifically bound to human AT1 receptor. Radioligand binding 
      assays revealed nanomolar affinity in several compounds under study. The IC50 
      values of nine ligands were higher than those of Losartan. The screening of 
      decreased blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats displayed that compound 
      8S (IC₅₀ = 5.0 nM) was equipotent with Losartan, whereas compounds 13R (IC₅₀ = 
      7.3 nM), 14R (IC₅₀ = 6.3 nM), and 14S (IC₅₀ = 3.5 nM) were slightly ahead of 
      Losartan, and the most significant activity was demonstrated by compound 8R (IC₅₀ 
      = 1.1 nM). Candidate 8R was identified for its excellent efficacy in 
      antihypertension and fairly low toxicity based on plasma analyses, toxicology 
      studies, and chronic oral tests. Finally, compound 8R exhibited strong and 
      multiple interactions with target active sites of the theoretical AT1 receptor 
      model in docking study.

TI  - Effects of salidroside on rat CYP enzymes by a cocktail of probe drugs.
PG  - 422-426
LID - 10.22038/IJBMS.2018.26106.6414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of salidroside on the 
      activities of the different drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
      CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in rats, in which a specific probe drug was used for each 
      enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After pretreatment with salidroside, five probe 
      drugs were simultaneously administered to rats by gavage. The given dose was 2.0 
      mg/kg for phenacetin (CYP1A2 activity), 4.0 mg/kg for bupropion (CYP2B6 
      activity), 2.0 mg/kg for losartan (CYP2C9 activity), 8.0 mg/kg for metoprolol 
      (CYP2D6 activity) and 1.0 mg/kg for midazolam (CYP3A4 activity). Then, an ultra 
      performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used 
      to analyze the concentrations of rats' blood, which were collected at different 
      corresponding times. RESULTS: Our data showed that salidroside exhibited an 
      inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activities by changing the 
      main pharmacokinetic parameters (t1/2, CL/F, Cmax and AUC(0-∞)) of the four probe 
      drugs in rats. However, no significant changes in CYP2D6 activity were observed. 
      CONCLUSION: In a word, the results displayed that salidroside could induce the 
      activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which may influence the 
      disposition of the drugs that are mainly metabolized by these pathways. Our 
      research can provide the basis for the study of related herb-drug interactions in 
      clinic.

TI  - Role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases in angiotensin II-stimulated 
      contraction of smooth muscle cells from human resistance arteries.
PG  - 392-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 
      in Ang II-stimulated contraction and associated signaling pathways in vascular 
      smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from human small arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS: VSMCs 
      derived from resistance arteries (<300 microm in diameter) from subcutaneous 
      gluteal biopsies of healthy subjects (n=8) were used to assess Ang II-stimulated 
      [Ca2+]i, pHi, and contractile responses. [Ca2+]i and pHi were measured with fura 
      2-AM and BCECF-AM, respectively, and contraction was measured 
      photomicroscopically in cells grown on Matrigel matrix. To determine whether 
      tyrosine kinases and ERKs influence Ang II-stimulated responses, cells were 
      pretreated with 10(-5) mol/L tyrphostin A-23 (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and 
      PD98059 (MEK inhibitor). Ang II-stimulated MEK activity was determined by 
      tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs. The angiotensin receptor subtypes (AT1 and AT2) 
      were assessed with [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (a nonselective subtype antagonist), 
      losartan (a selective AT1 antagonist), and PD123319 (a selective AT2 antagonist). 
      Ang II dose-dependently increased [Ca2+]i (pD2=8.4+/-0.36, Emax=541+/-55 nmol/L), 
      pHi (pD2=9. 4+/-0.29, Emax=7.19+/-0.01), and contraction (pD2=9.2+/-0.21, 
      Emax=36+/-2.2%). Ang II induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs, which was 
      inhibited by PD98059. Tyrphostin A-23 and PD98059 attenuated (P<0.05) Ang 
      II-stimulated second messengers, and PD98059 reduced Ang II-induced contraction 
      by >50%. [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and losartan, but not PD123319, blocked Ang 
      II-stimulated responses. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that in VSMCs from 
      human peripheral resistance arteries, functional Ang II receptors of the AT1 
      subtype are coupled to signaling cascades involving Ca2+ and pHi pathways that 
      are partially dependent on tyrosine kinases and ERKs. ERKs, the signaling 
      cascades characteristically associated with cell growth, may play an important 
      role in Ang II-stimulated contraction of human VSMCs.

TI  - [Resistant hypertension and paradox effect in patient with hemodialysis 
      treatment].
PG  - 235-9
AB  - This is a case study of a 65-year-old female, on regular haemodialysis treatment, 
      with resistant hypertension and paradoxical blood pressure (BP) elevation during 
      dialysis. This phenomenon occurs in a small number of patients, since in most 
      patients an acceptable BP is usually reached by adequate control of fluid and 
      volume status with dialysis, sometimes associated with pharmacologic 
      intervention. Since in our patient hypertension persisted despite apparent 
      achievement of dry weight and maintenance of antihypertensive medications, we did 
      some extensive investigations to disclose any secondary causes of hypertension 
      (other than ESRD); we also evaluated whether the optimal dry weight was really 
      achieved and maintained, and if the pharmacokinetics of the antihypertensive 
      drugs was influenced by dialysis. We found no secondary cause of hypertension; by 
      contrast, we detected the presence of a mild cardiac dilatation, and realized 
      that some antihypertensive drugs, taken by our patient, were removed by dialysis. 
      Since both these are known to precipitate the paradoxical BP rise during 
      dialysis, we successfully modified once again our dialysis strategy and changed 
      the antihypertensive therapy, adding a calcium antagonist to both losartan and 
      low-dose minoxidil.

AB  - Due to the current analytical processes that are not able to measure all the 
      pharmaceutical molecules and to the high costs and the consumption of time to 
      sample and analyze PhACs, models to calculate Predicted Environmental 
      Concentrations (PECs) have been developed. However a comparison between MECs and 
      PECs, taking into account the methods of calculations and peculiarly the 
      parameters included in the calculation (consumption data, pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, elimination rate in STPs and in the environment), is necessary to 
      assess the validity of PECs. MEC variations of sixteen target PhACs 
      [acetaminophen (ACE), amlodipine (AML), atenolol (ATE), caffeine (CAF), 
      carbamazepine (CAR), doxycycline (DOX), epoxycarbamazepine (EPO), fluvoxamine 
      (FLU), furosemide (FUR), hydrochlorothiazide (HYD), ifosfamide (IFO), losartan 
      (LOS), pravastatin (PRA), progesterone (PROG), ramipril (RAM), trimetazidine 
      (TRI)] have been evaluated during one hydrological cycle, from October 2011 to 
      October 2012 and compared to PECs calculated by using an adaptation of the models 
      proposed by Heberer and Feldmann (2005) and EMEA (2006). Comparison of PECs and 
      MECS has been achieved for six molecules: ATE, CAR, DOX, FUR, HYD and PRA. DOX, 
      FUR and HYD present differences between PECs and MECs on an annual basis but 
      their temporal evolutions follow the same trends. PEC evaluation for these PhACs 
      could then be possible but need some adjustments of consumption patterns, 
      pharmacokinetic parameters and/or mechanisms of (bio)degradation. ATE, CAR and 
      PRA are well modeled; PECs can then be used as reliable estimation of 
      concentrations without any reserve.

TI  - The CYP2C9 polymorphism: from enzyme kinetics to clinical dose recommendations.
PG  - 63-84
LID - 10.1517/17410541.1.1.63 [doi]
AB  - CYP2C9 is the major human enzyme of the cytochrome P450 2C subfamily and 
      metabolizes approximately 10% of all therapeutically relevant drugs. Two 
      inherited SNPs termed CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and *3 (Ile359Leu) are known to affect 
      catalytic function. Numerous rare or functionally silent polymorphisms have been 
      identified. About 35% of the Caucasian population carries at least one *2 or *3 
      allele. CYP2C9 metabolizes several oral hypoglycemics, oral anticoagulants, 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other drugs, including phenytoin, 
      losartan, fluvastatin, and torsemide. In vitro studies with several drugs 
      indicate that the Cys144 (.2) and Leu359 (.3) variants confer only about 70 and 
      10% of the intrinsic clearance of the wild-type protein (.1), respectively. The 
      clinical pharmacokinetic implications of these polymorphisms vary depending on 
      the enzymes contribution to total oral clearance. Several studies demonstrated 
      that the CYP2C9 polymorphisms are medically important for non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, for oral hypoglycemics, vitamin K antagonistic oral 
      anticoagulants, and phenytoin. In particular, CYP2C9 polymorphisms should be 
      routinely considered in therapy with oral anticoagulants where severe adverse 
      events at initiation of therapy might be reduced by genotyping. CYP2C9 
      polymorphisms were also clinically associated with side effects of phenytoin, 
      with gastric bleeding during therapy with non-steroidals and with hypoglycemia 
      under oral hypoglycemic drugs. Data appear mature enough for the routine 
      consideration of CYP2C9 genotypes in therapy with acenocoumarol, phenytoin, 
      warfarin, and some other drugs. Nevertheless, it is advisable before the routine 
      clinical use of these genotype data to rigorously test the benefits of 
      genotype-based therapeutic recommendations by randomized controlled clinical 
      trials.

TI  - [Mechanisms of drug interactions with renal elimination of lithium].
PG  - 685-95; discussion 695-7
AB  - Using indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg/day, i.m.) in rats, we confirmed the well-known 
      interaction of NSAID's and the urinary elimination of lithium. This is due to an 
      increase in the tubular reabsorption of lithium, probably associated with an 
      increase in the reabsorption of sodium in the ascending limb of the loop of 
      Henle, following inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. With ramipril (1 
      mg/kg/day, p.o.), we confirmed an interaction with lithium pharmacokinetics in 
      rats, also associated with an increase in the tubular reabsorption of sodium. In 
      contrast, the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) had 
      no effect in this paradigm. Since the effects of ramipril were partially 
      inhibited by an i.v. infusion of an antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor 
      icatibant (0.1 mg/kg/day), we suggest that bradykinin contributes to the 
      interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and renal excretion 
      of lithium.

AB  - The angiotensin II receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor 
      blockers (ARBs), are a family of agents that bind to and inhibit the angiotensin 
      II type 1 receptor (AT1) and thus inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and its 
      cascade of effects in causing arteriolar contraction and sodium retention. While 
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin 
      I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs 
      inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as 
      well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used 
      widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of 
      hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in 
      clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical 
      structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan 
      (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996), irbesartan (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan 
      (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), 
      olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents 
      have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during 
      chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self 
      limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the 
      ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute liver injury that is 
      usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being 
      usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common 
      presentation of liver injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis 
      arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. 
      Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute liver 
      failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of 
      clinically apparent liver injury have been published in the literature for 
      losartan, valsartan, irbesartan olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically 
      for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have 
      been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and 
      particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like 
      enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight 
      loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 
      months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological 
      findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal 
      villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and 
      endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and 
      there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, 
      however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of 
      duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had 
      accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and fatty liver by imaging or 
      liver biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the 
      medication.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angiotensin receptor-NEP inhibitor (ARNi), which includes 
      an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a neprilysin inhibitor (NEPi), has been 
      proven safe and effective for treating heart failure with reduced ejection 
      fraction (HF-REF). S086 is a novel single-molecule ARNi that includes the 
      molecular moieties of EXP3174 (the active metabolite of the ARB losartan) and 
      sacubitril (a NEP inhibitor prodrug) in a 1:1 M ratio. We performed preclinical 
      animal model studies to evaluate the efficacy of S086 in treating HF. 
      EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat and dog models of myocardial ischemia-induced chronic 
      heart failure were used in this research. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The oral 
      administration of S086 dose-dependently lowered the heart weight index, 
      attenuated cardiac fibrosis, and improved left ventricular ejection fraction, 
      shortening fraction, and cardiac output, without effects on hemodynamics in 
      animal models of myocardial ischemia-induced chronic heart failure. A comparable 
      protective effect to LCZ696 was observed for S086 at an equal molar dose in dog 
      models. In addition, S086 was superior to LCZ696 since it significantly reversed 
      the decrease in left ventricular posterior wall end-systolic thickness. 
      CONCLUSION: This animal study suggests that S086 is effective in treating 
      myocardial ischemia-induced chronic heart failure.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of angiotensin receptor blockers on CYP2C9 activity in human 
      liver microsomes.
PG  - 267-75
AB  - We investigated the inhibitory effects of the angiotensin receptor blockers 
      (ARBs), candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, losartan active metabolite (EXP-3174), 
      olmesartan, telmisartan and valsartan (0.3-300 microM), on the CYP2C9 activity in 
      human liver microsomes using (S)-(-)-warfarin as a typical CYP2C9 substrate. 
      Except for olmesartan and valsartan, these ARBs inhibited the activity of 
      7-hydroxylation of (S)-(-)-warfarin with IC50 values of 39.5-116 microM. Of six 
      synthetic derivatives of olmesartan, five compounds which possess either alkyl 
      groups or a chloro group at the same position as that of the hydroxyisopropyl 
      group in olmesartan inhibited CYP2C9 activity with IC50 values of 21.7-161 
      microM. Olmesartan and the olmesartan analogue, RNH-6272, both having a 
      hydroxyisopropyl group, showed no inhibition, indicating that the hydrophilicity 
      of this group greatly contributes to the lack of CYP2C9 inhibition by these two 
      compounds. A three-dimensional model for docking between EXP-3174 and CYP2C9 
      indicated that the chloro group of EXP-3174 is oriented to a hydrophobic pocket 
      in the CYP2C9 active site, indicating that the lipophilicity of the group present 
      in ARBs at the position corresponding to that of the hydroxyisopropyl group in 
      olmesartan is important in inhibiting CYP2C9 activity.

TI  - Involvement of uric acid transporters in alteration of serum uric acid level by 
      angiotensin II receptor blockers.
PG  - 639-46
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the mechanisms of the alteration of serum uric acid level by 
      angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), the effects of ARBs on renal uric acid 
      transporters, including OAT1, OAT3, OAT4, and MRP4, were evaluated. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Uptakes of uric acid by OAT1-expressing Flp293 cells, by Xenopus oocytes 
      expressing OAT3 or OAT4, and by membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells expressing MRP4 
      were evaluated in the presence or absence of ARBs. RESULTS: All ARBs inhibited 
      uptake of uric acid or estrone-3-sulfate by OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4 in concentration 
      dependent manners. Among them, the IC50 values of valsartan, olmesartan and 
      pratosartan for OAT3 were comparable to clinically observed unbound maximum 
      plasma concentration of ARBs. Candesartan, losartan, and telmisartan inhibited 
      ATP-dependent uptake of uric acid by MRP4 at 10 microM. The IC50 value of 
      losartan for MRP4 was comparable to the estimated kidney tissue concentration of 
      losartan. No ARBs showed trans-stimulatory effects on the uptake of 
      estrone-3-sulfate by OAT4. CONCLUSION: Valsartan, olmesartan, and pratosartan 
      could inhibit the OAT3-mediated uric acid secretion in clinical situations. 
      Furthermore losartan could inhibit ATP-dependent uric acid secretion by MRP4. 
      These effects may explain partially the alteration of serum uric acid level by 
      ARBs.

TI  - Do concentrations of pharmaceuticals in sewage reflect prescription figures?
PG  - 9110-8
LID - 10.1007/s11356-014-4066-2 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, it has been demonstrated that sewage-based epidemiology can 
      deliver interesting information on trends in illicit drug consumption. However, 
      until now, no real evidence exists that the measured concentrations of drugs in 
      sewage can be exactly correlated with the amounts of drugs used by a specific 
      population. This study aimed therefore at correlating detailed monthly 
      prescription figures of 11 pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bisoprolol, citalopram, 
      fluoxetine, venlafaxine, losartan, telmisartan, valsartan, carbamazepine, 
      metformin, and tramadol) with measured concentrations of these compounds in 
      influent sewage from five sewage treatment plants in Belgium. For 7 out of the 11 
      substances, a ratio between loads calculated from the prescription figures and 
      loads calculated from measured concentrations in the range of 0.30-3.00 was 
      observed. For four pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bisoprolol, telmisartan, and 
      venlafaxine), the observed relationship was less pronounced. The manuscript gives 
      an overview of the possible uncertainties that are related with the calculated 
      correlations. This study highlights the need for gathering all the necessary 
      information regarding sewage sampling, stability of substances in sewage, 
      pharmacokinetics, and analytical method performance when sewage-based 
      epidemiology studies are performed.

      the 4-phenylquinoline structure.
PG  - 2574-86
AB  - Novel AT(1) receptor antagonists bearing substituted 4-phenylquinoline moieties 
      instead of the classical biphenyl fragment were designed and synthesized as the 
      first step of an investigation devoted to the development of new antihypertensive 
      agents and to the understanding of the molecular basis of their pharmacodynamic 
      and pharmacokinetic properties. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for 
      their potential ability to displace [(125)I]Sar(1),Ile(8)-Ang II specifically 
      bound to AT(1) receptor in rat hepatic membranes. These AT(1) receptor binding 
      studies revealed nanomolar affinity in several of the compounds under study. The 
      most potent ligands 4b,t were found to be equipotent with losartan and possessed 
      either a 3-tetrazolylquinoline or a 2-amino-3-quinolinecarboxylic moiety, 
      respectively. Moreover, some selected compounds were evaluated for antagonism of 
      Ang II-induced contraction in rabbit aortic strips, and the most potent compounds 
      in the binding test 4b,t were slightly more potent than losartan in inhibiting 
      Ang II-induced contraction. Finally, the most relevant structure-affinity 
      relationship data were rationalized by means of computational studies performed 
      on the isolated ligands as well as by computational simulations on the ligands 
      complexed with a theoretical AT(1) receptor model.

TI  - Pharmacological characterization of the novel nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist, BIBR 277.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - 1. The pharmacological profile of BIBR 277, 
      4'-[(1,4'-dimethyl-2'-propyl[2,6'-bi-1H-benzimidazol]-1'-yl)methyl ]- 
      [1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic acid, a novel, nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor 
      antagonist has been investigated by use of receptor binding studies, enzymatic 
      assays, functional in vitro assays in rabbit aorta as well as in vivo experiments 
      in pithed, anaesthetized and conscious rats. 2. BIBR 277 potently interacted with 
      rat AT1 receptors (Ki 3.7 nM). Competitive receptor interaction was shown by 
      radioligand saturation experiments performed in the presence of BIBR 277. The 
      failure to inhibit radioligand binding to AT2 sites demonstrates the selectivity 
      of BIBR 277 for AT1 receptors. This is further substantiated by the findings that 
      BIBR 277 neither interacted with other receptor systems investigated nor affected 
      the activity of components of the human renin-angiotensin system, such as plasma 
      renin or serum converting enzyme. 3. In rabbit aorta, BIBR 277 had no agonistic 
      properties and was shown to be an insurmountable antagonist of angiotensin 
      II-induced contractions (KB 0.33 nM). The antagonistic effect persisted even 
      after several wash-out procedures. However, this interaction was not irreversible 
      since the insurmountable antagonism was concentration-dependently reversed when 
      BIBR 277 (0.1 microM) and the surmountable antagonist, losartan (0.1 and 1.0 
      microM) were incubated simultaneously. The specificity of BIBR 277 for the AT1 
      receptor was further substantiated in this preparation since micromolar 
      concentrations of BIBR 277 neither affected potassium chloride and 
      noradrenaline-induced contractions nor acetylcholine-mediated tissue relaxation. 
      4. In pithed rats, i.v. administration of BIBR 277 (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg-1) 
      shifted the dose-pressor response curve to angiotensin II dose-dependently to the 
      right with ED50 values of 0.23 microg kg-1 (control)and 1.4 microg kg-1, 4.7 
      microg kg-1 and 20 microg kg-1, respectively. As observed in the in vitro 
      experiments no agonistic effect was detected and the maximum of the blood 
      pressure response to angiotensin II at the highest dose of BIBR 277 was decreased 
      by 29%.5. In anaesthetized rats, bolus i.v. administration of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg 
      kg-1 BIBR 277 attenuated the blood pressure response to bolus i.v. injections of 
      angiotensin 11 (0.1 microg kg-1). At the highest dose an almost complete blockade 
      was observed even after 2 h.6. Single oral administration of BIBR 277 (0.3 and 
      1.0 mg kg-1) to conscious, chronically instrumented renovascular hypertensive 
      rats dose-dependently decreased the mean arterial blood pressure by 15 and 30 
      mmHg, respectively. At the higher dose a significant antihypertensive effect was 
      maintained for more than 24 h. Moreover, consecutive daily dosing of 1 mg kg-1 
      orally resulted in a sustained reduction in blood pressure over the 4 day 
      observation period.7. It is concluded that BIBR 277 is an effective and selective 
      angiotensin II antagonist with antihypertensive activity after oral 
      administration.

AB  - Phytochemicals (Pch) present in fruits, vegetables and other foods, are known to 
      inhibit or induce drug metabolism and transport. An exhaustive search was 
      performed in five databases covering from 2000 to 2021. Twenty-one compounds from 
      plants were found to modulate CYP3A and/or P-gp activities and modified the 
      pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic effect of 27 different drugs. Flavonols, 
      flavanones, flavones, stilbenes, diferuloylmethanes, tannins, protoalkaloids, 
      flavans, hyperforin and terpenes, reduce plasma concentration of cyclosporine, 
      simvastatin, celiprolol, midazolam, saquinavir, buspirone, everolimus, nadolol, 
      tamoxifen, alprazolam, verapamil, quazepam, digoxin, fexofenadine, theophylline, 
      indinavir, clopidogrel. Anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavonoid 
      glycosides, stilbenes, diferuloylmethanes, catechin, hyperforin, alkaloids, 
      terpenes, tannins and protoalkaloids increase of plasma concentration of 
      buspirone, losartan, diltiazem, felodipine, midazolam, cyclosporine, triazolam, 
      verapamil, carbamazepine, diltiazem, aripiprazole, tamoxifen, doxorubicin, 
      paclitaxel, nicardipine. Interactions between Pchs and drugs affect the gene 
      expression and enzymatic activity of CYP3A and P-gp transporter, which has an 
      impact on their bioavailability; such that co-administration of drugs with food, 
      beverages and food supplements can cause a subtherapeutic effect or overdose. 
      Therefore, it is important for the clinician to consider these interactions to 
      obtain a better therapeutic effect.

TI  - Albumin induces CD44 expression in glomerular parietal epithelial cells by 
      activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway.
PG  - 7224-7235
LID - 10.1002/jcp.27477 [doi]
AB  - De novo expression of CD44 in glomerular parietal epithelial cells (PECs) leads 
      to a prosclerotic and migratory PEC phenotype in glomerulosclerosis. However, the 
      regulatory mechanisms underlying CD44 expression by activated PECs remain largely 
      unknown. This study was performed to examine the mediators responsible for CD44 
      induction in glomerular PECs in association with diabetes. CD44 expression and 
      localization were evaluated in the glomeruli of Zucker diabetic rat kidneys and 
      primary cultured PECs upon albumin stimulation. Real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction confirmed an albuminuria-associated upregulation of the CD44 gene in the 
      glomeruli of diabetic rats. Immunostaining analysis of diabetic kidneys further 
      revealed an increase in CD44 in hypertrophic PECs, which often contain 
      albumin-positive vesicles. Losartan treatment significantly attenuated 
      albuminuria and lowered CD44 protein levels in the diabetic kidneys. In primary 
      cultured rat PECs, rat serum albumin (0.25-1 mg/ml) caused a dose-dependent 
      upregulation of CD44, claudin-1, and megalin protein expression, which was 
      accompanied by an activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) 
      signaling. Albumin-induced CD44 and claudin-1 expression were greatly suppressed 
      in the presence of the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. In addition, knockdown of megalin 
      by small interfering RNA interference in PECs resulted in a significant reduction 
      of albumin-induced CD44 and claudin-1 proteins. Taken together, our results 
      demonstrate that albumin induces CD44 expression by PECs via the activation of 
      the ERK signaling pathway, which is partially mediated by endocytic receptor 
      megalin.

TI  - Systematic review on the effects of medication under hyperbaric conditions: 
      consequences for the diver.
PG  - 127-136
LID - 10.28920/dhm49.2.127-136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiological changes are induced by immersion, swimming and using 
      diving equipment. Divers must be fit to dive. Using medication may impact the 
      capacity to adapt to hyperbaric conditions. The aim of this systematic review is 
      to assess the interaction of diving/hyperbaric conditions and medication and to 
      provide basic heuristics to support decision making regarding fitness to dive in 
      medicated divers. METHODS: This was a systematic review of human and animal 
      studies of medications in the hyperbaric environment. Studies were subdivided 
      into those describing a medication/hyperbaric environment interaction and those 
      concerned with prevention of diving disorders. Studies without a relation to 
      diving with compressed air, and those concerning oxygen toxicity, hyperbaric 
      oxygen therapy or the treatment of decompression sickness were excluded. RESULTS: 
      Forty-four studies matched the inclusion criteria. Animal studies revealed that 
      diazepam and valproate gave limited protection against the onset of the 
      high-pressure neurological syndrome. Lithium had a protective effect against 
      nitrogen-narcosis and losartan reduced cardiac changes in repetitive diving. 
      Human studies showed no beneficial or dangerous pressure-related interactions. In 
      prevention of diving disorders, pseudoephedrine reduced otic barotrauma, vitamins 
      C and E reduced endothelial dysfunction after bounce diving and hepatic oxidative 
      stress in saturation diving. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Animal studies revealed 
      that psycho-pharmaceuticals can limit the onset of neurologic symptoms and 
      cardiovascular protective drugs might add a potential protective effect against 
      decompression sickness. No evidence of significant risks due to changes in 
      pharmacologic mechanisms were revealed and most medication is not a 
      contraindication to diving. For improving decision making in prescribing medicine 
      for recreational and occupational divers and to enhance safety by increasing our 
      understanding of pharmacology in hyperbaric conditions, future research should 
      focus on controlled human studies.

AB  - The synthesis and pharmacological activity of a new series of 
      5-(biphenyl-4-ylmethyl)pyrazoles as potent angiotensin II antagonists both in 
      vitro (binding of [3H]AII) and in vivo (iv, inhibition of AII-induced increase in 
      blood pressure, pithed rats; po, furosemide-treated sodium-depleted rats) are 
      reported. The various substituents of the pyrazole ring have been modified taking 
      into account the receptor's requirements derived from related structure-activity 
      relationship studies. A propyl or butyl group at position 1 as well as a 
      carboxylic acid group at position 4 were shown to be essential for high affinity. 
      Different groups at position 3 (H, small alkyl, phenyl, benzyl) provided good 
      binding affinity, but oral activity was highly discriminating: bulky alkyl groups 
      provided the highest potencies. Among the acidic isosteres tested in the biphenyl 
      moiety, the tetrazole group proved to be the best. Compound 14n 
      (3-tert-butyl-1-propyl-5-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-y l] 
      methyl]-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, UR-7280) shows high potency both in vitro 
      (IC50 = 3 nM) and in vivo (iv, 61.2 +/- 10% decrease in blood pressure at 0.3 
      mg/kg; po, 30 mmHg fall in blood pressure at 0.3 mg/kg), in comparison to 
      losartan (IC50 = 59 nM; iv, 62.5 +/- 8.9% decrease in blood pressure at 1 mg/kg; 
      po, 13 mmHg fall in blood pressure at 3 mg/kg). These data, together with the 
      good pharmacokinetic profile of 14n in different species, have led to its 
      selection for clinical evaluation as an antihypertensive agent.

AB  - Three new angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists, 1, 2 and 3 were designed, 
      synthesized and evaluated. The AT1 receptor-binding assays in vitro showed that 
      all the synthesized compounds had nanomolar affinity for the AT1 receptor. From 
      which compound 3 was found to be the most potent ligands with an IC50 value of 
      2.67±0.23 nM. Biological evaluation in vivo revealed that all the compounds could 
      cause significant decrease on MBP in a dose dependent manner in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats, and compound 3 especially showed an efficient and long-lasting 
      effect in reducing blood pressure, whose maximal response lowered 41 mmHg of MBP 
      at 10mg/kg and 62 mmHg at 15 mg/kg after oral administration, the significant 
      anti-hypertensive effect lasted beyond 12 h, which is better than the reference 
      compound losartan. The pharmacokinetic experiments showed that compound 3 could 
      be absorbed efficiently and metabolized smoothly both in blood and in tissues in 
      Wistar rats. The acute toxicity assay suggested that it has low toxicity with the 
      LD50 value of 2974.35 mg/kg. These results demonstrate that compound 3 is a 
      potent angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist which could be considered as a novel 
      anti-hypertension candidate and deserved for further investigation.

TI  - Role of bradykinin B2 receptors in the developmental changes of renal 
      hemodynamics in the neonatal rat.
PG  - F786-92
AB  - The present study was performed to evaluate the role of bradykinin, acting via B2 
      receptors, in the developmental rise in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) in the rat. Newborn rats were chronically treated from 
      birth with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 (600 micrograms/kg sc, every 
      12 h, n = 9) or 0.9% saline (n = 7). Weanling rats (mean age 23 days) were 
      anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg ip) for measurements of mean 
      arterial pressure (MAP), GFR, and renal plasma flow estimated from 
      p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance (ERPF). Outer cortical RBF (OCBF) was measured 
      by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Baseline MAP was similar in HOE-140- and 
      saline-treated rats (96 +/- 4 vs. 97 +/- 4 mmHg). Also, baseline GFR (0.65 +/- 
      0.05 vs. 0.52 +/- 0.08 ml.min-1.g-1) and ERPF (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1 
      ml.min-1.g-1) were not different in HOE-140- and saline-treated rats, 
      respectively. Intravenous infusion of 200 ng bradykinin did not change MAP or 
      OCBF in HOE-140 rats but decreased MAP (-29 +/- 3%, P < 0.05) and OCBF (-20 +/- 
      2%, P < 0.05) in controls. Intravenous infusion of 25 ng angiotensin II increased 
      MAP equally in both groups (-32 +/- 4%) and caused a similar reduction in OCBF 
      (-37 +/- 14 vs. -46 +/- 5%). The angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist 
      losartan (10 mg/kg iv) decreased MAP equally in both groups (-22 +/- 2%). 
      However, AT1 blockade increased ERPF to 3.1 +/- 0.8 ml.min-1.g-1 (P < 0.05 vs. 
      baseline) in saline but not in HOE-140 rats (1.9 +/- 0.4 ml.min-1.g-1). Kidney 
      renin mRNA and angiotensin II contents were not different in HOE-140 vs. saline 
      groups. The present findings indicate that bradykinin is not a primary mediator 
      of the maturational rise in RBF or GFR in the rat. However, the data suggest that 
      under control conditions, angiotensin II, acting via AT1 receptors, counteracts 
      the renal vasodilatory effects of endogenous bradykinin in the developing kidney.

TI  - Effects of the antifungal agents on oxidative drug metabolism: clinical 
      relevance.
PG  - 111-80
AB  - This article reviews the metabolic pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with 
      the systemic antifungal agents: the azoles ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole 
      and fluconazole, the allylamine terbinafine and the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole. 
      The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of 
      coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case 
      reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy 
      volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting 
      effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP 
      isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic 
      extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods 
      used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then 
      discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and 
      itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in 
      humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as 
      cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, 
      felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can 
      result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be 
      life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and 
      tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and 
      cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The 
      potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical 
      interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser 
      magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 
      mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of 
      CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan 
      with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole 
      is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of 
      this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have 
      been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily 
      metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 
      and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates 
      of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, 
      encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo 
      data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are 
      unlikely.

TI  - UPLC-MS/MS Based Identification and Quantification of a Novel Dual Orexin 
      Receptor Antagonist in Plasma Samples by Validated SWGTOX Guidelines.
LID - 10.3390/toxics11020109 [doi]
LID - 109
AB  - Lemborexant (LEM) is a novel dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA), recently 
      approved for the treatment of insomnia. As with other DORAs, LEM has potential of 
      abuse and therefore placed in Schedule IV class by the United States Drug 
      Enforcement Administration (USDEA). In this study, a sensitive and accurate 
      UPLC-MS/MS assay was developed for the quantification of LEM in human plasma 
      sample using losartan as an internal standard (IS). The chromatographic 
      separation was performed by using gradient elution of mobile phase, comprising of 
      10 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. An 
      Acquity UPLC BEH C(18) (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) column was used for separation of 
      LEM and IS by maintaining the oven temperature of 40 °C. The electrospray 
      ionization in positive mode was used for sample ionization. The precursor to 
      product ion transition of 411.12 > 175.09 (qualifier) and 411.1 > 287.14 
      (quantifier) was used for detection and quantification of LEM, respectively, in 
      multiple reaction monitoring mode. Being a drug of abuse, the assay was validated 
      according to "Scientific Working Group for Toxicology" (SWGTOX) guidelines, 
      including limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision and 
      bias, calibration model, interferences, carry-over effects, matrix effects, and 
      stability parameters. The LOD and LOQ of the assay were 0.35 and 1.0 ng/mL, 
      respectively. The linear range was between 1-300 ng/mL with correlation 
      coefficient of ≥0.995. The method was also cross validated in rat plasma samples 
      with acceptable ranges of precision and accuracy before its application for 
      pharmacokinetic study in rats.

TI  - Aortic Uptake of (18)F-NaF and (18)F-FDG and Calcification Predict the 
      Development of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms and Is Attenuated by Drug Therapy.
PG  - 1975-1985
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.321110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysms expand over time and increase the risk of 
      fatal ruptures. To predict expansion, the isolated assessment of 
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and sodium fluoride (NaF) uptake or calcification 
      volume in aneurysms has been investigated with variability in results. We 
      systematically evaluated whether (18)F-FDG and (18)F-NaF uptake was predictive of 
      abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion. METHODS: Seventy-four male Sprague-Dawley 
      rat abdominal aortic aneurysm models were imaged using positron emission 
      tomography-computed tomography with (18)F-FDG and (18)F-NaF at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 
      weeks after CaCl(2) or saline stimulation. In the 1-week cohort (n=25), the 
      correlation between (18)F-FDG or (18)F-NaF uptake and pathological markers was 
      investigated. In the time course cohort (n=49), animals received either 
      atorvastatin, losartan, aldactone, or risedronate to assess the effect of these 
      drugs, and the relationship between aortic size and sequential (18)F-FDG and 
      (18)F-NaF uptake or calcification volume was examined. RESULTS: In the 1-week 
      cohort, the maximum standard unit value of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-NaF uptake 
      correlated with CD68- (r=0.82; P=0.001) and von Kossa staining-positive areas 
      (r=0.89; P<0.001), respectively. In the time course cohort, (18)F-FDG and 
      (18)F-NaF uptake changed in a time-dependent manner and drugs attenuated this 
      uptake. Specifically, (18)F-FDG showed high uptake at weeks 1 and 2, whereas a 
      high (18)F-NaF uptake was noted throughout the study period. Atorvastatin and 
      risedronate showed a decreased and increased aortic size, respectively. The final 
      aortic area correlated well with (18)F-FDG and (18)F-NaF uptake and calcification 
      volume, especially at 1 and 2 weeks ((18)F-NaF [1 week]: r=0.61, (18)F-FDG [2 
      weeks]: r=0.51, calcification volume [1 week]: r=0.59; P<0.001). Multiple linear 
      regression analysis showed that the combination of these factors predicted the 
      final aortic size, with (18)F-NaF uptake at 1 week being the strongest predictor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of (18)F-NaF and (18)F-FDG and the calcification volume 
      at appropriate times correlated with the development of abdominal aortic 
      aneurysms, with (18)F-NaF uptake being the strongest predictor.

      or Belsar Plus].
PG  - 175-9
AB  - The therapeutic control of hypertension is still a global challenge and 
      frequently requires combination therapy. Olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide 
      (Olmetec plus, Belsar plus) is a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan 20 mg and 
      hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg. Olmesartan is a well known angiotensin II AT1 
      receptor blocker characterized by a good efficacy, a fast and prolonged duration 
      of action and a placebo-like tolerability. With the combination therapy, no 
      significant change of pharmacokinetics of either component is observed. The 
      fixed-dose combination results in a greater blood pressure reduction compared to 
      monotherapy with either component. This is at least effective as or even more 
      effective than the combination of atenolol or losartan with hydrochlorothiazide, 
      respectively. The responder rate is about 90%. The safety and tolerability remain 
      excellent. Beyond the antihypertensive effect, olmesartan significantly reduces 
      vascular inflammation and the wall-to-lumen ration in arteries. The starting dose 
      is 20/12.5 mg.

TI  - Olmesartan medoxomil: the seventh angiotensin receptor antagonist.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse 
      effects of olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist for the 
      treatment of hypertension. DATA SOURCES: Information was obtained from MEDLINE 
      searches (1996-April 2002) of English-language medical literature. Search terms 
      included CS-866, olmesartan, olmesartan medoxomil, RNH-6270 (active metabolite of 
      olmesartan), Benicar, angiotensin receptors, and antihypertensive agents. In 
      addition, references from relevant articles were reviewed for additional 
      citations. The authors independently reviewed literature identified in the 
      searches. Studies evaluating olmesartan (i.e., abstracts, clinical trials, data 
      on file with manufacturer) were considered for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION: All 
      articles identified from data sources with pertinent information regarding 
      olmesartan medoxomil were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was 
      included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Olmesartan medoxomil is a competitively 
      priced addition to the class of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monotherapy 
      with olmesartan medoxomil in once-daily doses of 20-40 mg has produced 
      significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive 
      patients. Adverse effects have been minimal with olmesartan medoxomil, with 
      dizziness being the only adverse effect occurring more often than with placebo in 
      clinical trials. Additionally, animal studies indicate that olmesartan medoxomil 
      may prove to be useful treatment for diabetic nephropathy, as well as 
      atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Olmesartan medoxomil has a favorable safety and 
      efficacy profile, with blood pressure-lowering effects comparable to those of 
      other angiotensin receptor blockers (i.e., losartan, valsartan, irbesartan). At 
      this time, formulary decisions will be driven primarily by economic issues. 
      Theoretical benefits of olmesartan medoxomil in reducing atherogenesis and 
      lowering angiotensin II concentrations better than the alternative agents will be 
      determined only with more extensive research.

AB  - To understand interaction of drugs with the prostaglandin transporter 
      OATP2A1/SLCO2A1 that regulates disposition of prostaglandins, we explored the 
      impact of 636 drugs in an FDA-approved drug library on 6-carboxyfluorescein 
      (6-CF) uptake by OATP2A1-expressing HEK293 cells (HEK/2A1). Fifty-one and 10 
      drugs were found to inhibit and enhance 6-CF uptake by more than 50%, 
      respectively. Effect of the 51 drugs on 6-CF uptake was positively correlated 
      with that on PGE(2) uptake (r = 0.64, p < 0.001). Among those, 5 drugs not 
      structurally related to prostaglandins, suramin, pranlukast, zafirlukast, 
      olmesartan medoxomil, and losartan potassium, exhibited more than 90% PGE(2) 
      uptake inhibition. Inhibitory affinity of suramin to OATP2A1 was the highest 
      (IC(50,2A1) of 0.17 μM), and its IC(50) values to MRP4-mediated PGE(2) transport 
      (IC(50,MRP4)) and PGE(2) synthesis in human U-937 cells treated with phorbol 
      12-myristate 13-acetate (IC(50,Syn)) were 73.6 and 336.7 times higher than 
      IC(50,2A1), respectively. Moreover, structure-activity relationship study in 29 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs contained in the library displayed 
      inhibitory activities of anthranilic acid derivatives, but enhancing effects of 
      propionic acid derivatives. These results demonstrate that suramin is a potent 
      selective inhibitor of OATP2A1, providing a comprehensive information about drugs 
      in clinical use that interact with OATP2A1.

TI  - A novel method for the determination of the site of glucuronidation by ion 
      mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry.
PG  - 1456-9

AB  - Glucuronidation not only plays a detoxifying role in living body, but it also can 
      complicate pharmacological and toxicological profiles of new drug candidates by 
      forming active and reactive conjugated metabolites. The opportunity to elucidate 
      structure of conjugated metabolites has increased in drug metabolism studies at 
      the early development stage. General methodologies for the structure elucidation 
      of glucuronide conjugate(s) include liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and NMR spectroscopy. In many cases, LC-MS/MS alone 
      cannot unequivocally identify the site(s) of conjugation in isomeric 
      glucuronidations. In the present study, we established a new strategy for the 
      structure elucidation of glucuronide conjugates using ion mobility spectrometry 
      (IMS)-mass spectrometry. Linear correlation between calculated collision 
      cross-sections (CCS) and actual drift times from IMS was found for each set of 
      parent compound (raloxifene, losartan, telmisartan, and estradiol) and the 
      corresponding MS/MS product ions. Thus, obtained regression lines accurately and 
      selectively projected the actual drift times of authentic standards of 
      glucuronide conjugate based on the theoretical CCS values. The established method 
      was used for the accurate assignment of predominant formation of phenolic 
      glucuronide conjugate (SCH 60663) in the isomeric (phenolic and benzylic) 
      glucuronidations of ezetimibe in the incubated sample with cryopreserved human 
      hepatocytes. This application demonstrates the potential to facilitate the 
      structure identification of glucuronide conjugates at the early development stage 
      of new drug candidates.

TI  - Indications for and utilization of angiotensin receptor II blockers in patients 
      at high cardiovascular risk.
PG  - 605-22
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S23468 [doi]
AB  - The worldwide burden of cardiovascular disease is growing. In addition to 
      lifestyle changes, pharmacologic agents that can modify cardiovascular disease 
      processes have the potential to reduce cardiovascular events. Antihypertensive 
      agents are widely used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events partly beyond 
      that of blood pressure-lowering. In particular, the angiotensin II receptor 
      blockers (ARBs), which antagonize the vasoconstrictive and 
      proinflammatory/pro-proliferative effects of angiotensin II, have been shown to 
      be cardio vascularly protective and well tolerated. Although the eight currently 
      available ARBs are all indicated for the treatment of hypertension, they have 
      partly different pharmacology, and their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties differ. ARB trials for reduction of cardiovascular risk can be broadly 
      categorized into those in patients with/without hypertension and additional risk 
      factors, in patients with evidence of cardiovascular disease, and in patients 
      with severe cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure. These differences have 
      led to their indications in different populations. For hypertensive patients with 
      left ventricular hypertrophy, losartan was approved to have an indication for 
      stroke prevention, while for most patients at high-risk for cardiovascular 
      events, telmisartan is an appropriate therapy because it has a cardiovascular 
      preventive indication. Other ARBs are indicated for narrowly defined high-risk 
      patients, such as those with hypertension or heart failure. Although in one 
      analysis a possible link between ARBs and increased risks of cancer has surfaced, 
      several meta-analyses, using the most comprehensive data available, have found no 
      link between any ARB, or the class as a whole, and cancer. Most recently, the US 
      Food and Drug Administration completed a review of the potential risk of cancer 
      and concluded that treatment with an ARB medication does not increase the risk of 
      developing cancer. This review discusses the clinical evidence supporting the 
      different indications for each of the ARBs and the outstanding safety of this 
      drug class.

TI  - In vivo cytochrome P450 activity alterations in diabetic nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis mice.
LID - 10.1002/jbt.21840 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been identified as a source of 
      significant interindividual variation in drug metabolism. A previous ex vivo 
      study demonstrated significant changes in hepatic Cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity 
      in human NASH. This study evaluated the in vivo activities of multiple CYP 
      isoforms simultaneously in prominent diabetic NASH mouse models. The 
      pharmacokinetics of CYP selective substrates: caffeine, losartan, and omeprazole 
      changed significantly in a diabetic NASH mouse model, indicating attenuation of 
      the activity of Cyp1a2 and Cyp2c29, respectively. Decreased mRNA expression of 
      Cyp1a2 and Cyp2c29, as well as an overall decrease in CYP protein expression, was 
      found in the diabetic NASH mice. Overall, these data suggest that the diabetic 
      NASH model only partially recapitulates the human ex vivo CYP alteration pattern. 
      Therefore, in vivo determination of the effects of NASH on CYP activity should be 
      conducted in human, and more appropriate models are required for future drug 
      metabolism studies in NASH.

TI  - Lack of Correlation between In Vitro and In Vivo Studies on the Inhibitory 
      Effects of (‒)-Sophoranone on CYP2C9 is Attributable to Low Oral Absorption and 
      Extensive Plasma Protein Binding of (‒)-Sophoranone.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12040328 [doi]
LID - 328
AB  - (‒)-Sophoranone (SPN) is a bioactive component of Sophora tonkinensis with 
      various pharmacological activities. This study aims to evaluate its in vitro and 
      in vivo inhibitory potential against the nine major CYP enzymes. Of the nine 
      tested CYPs, it exerted the strongest inhibitory effect on CYP2C9-mediated 
      tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation with the lowest IC(50) (K(i)) value of 0.966 ± 0.149 
      μM (0.503 ± 0.0383 μM), in a competitive manner. Additionally, it strongly 
      inhibited other CYP2C9-catalyzed diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and losartan 
      oxidation activities. Upon 30 min pre-incubation of human liver microsomes with 
      SPN in the presence of NADPH, no obvious shift in IC(50) was observed, suggesting 
      that SPN is not a time-dependent inactivator of the nine CYPs. However, oral 
      co-administration of SPN had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
      diclofenac and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac in rats. Overall, SPN is a potent inhibitor 
      of CYP2C9 in vitro but not in vivo. The very low permeability of SPN in Caco-2 
      cells (P(app) value of 0.115 × 10(-6) cm/s), which suggests poor absorption in 
      vivo, and its high degree of plasma protein binding (>99.9%) may lead to the lack 
      of in vitro-in vivo correlation. These findings will be helpful for the safe and 
      effective clinical use of SPN.

TI  - Severe neutropenia in a renal transplant patient suggesting an interaction 
      between mycophenolate and fenofibrate.
PG  - 24-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient in whom initiation of micronized fenofibrate 
      precipitated mycophenolate induced neutropenia. CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old man 
      was admitted to the hospital because of febrile neutropenia. He had undergone 
      kidney transplantation seventeen years ago. The patient's immunosuppressive 
      maintenance regimen consisted of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 500 mg three times a 
      day, and meprednisone 4 mg daily. His medical history included, hypertension 
      treated with losartan 50mg daily, and dyslipidemia treated with ezetimibe 10mg 
      /simvastatin 20mg for four years (until 2 weeks before admission when micronized 
      fenofibrate 200 mg per day was started because of persistently elevated 
      triglycerides levels. On presentation temperature was 37.8°C and initial 
      laboratory tests showed 3130 White Blood Cell Count(WBC)/μL with neutropenia 
      (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 313/μL) Fenofibrate and mycophenolate mofetil 
      were discontinued, piperacillin tazobactam 4.5gr three times a day and 
      granulocyte stimulation factor 300 μg/day were started. Three days after 
      admission WBC was 7280/μL, neutrophils: 22%, ANC: 1160/mm(3). Mycophenolate 
      mofetil was restarted and granulocyte stimulation factor was discontinued. One 
      month after discharge his WBC was 4480/μL and ANC 1926/μL. DISCUSSION: The 
      initiation of fenofibrate in a patient on stable and therapeutic doses of 
      mycophenolate may have precipitated mycophenolate induced neutropenia, a well 
      described, dose dependent phenomenon. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) displays a complex 
      pharmacokinetic profile susceptible to potential significant interactions with 
      fenofibrate. Since approximately 99% of MPA and fenofibrate bind to albumin, 
      displacement may occur, leading to increased free MPA. Second competition of 
      fenofibric acid for UGT1A9 an enzyme implicated in conjugation of MPA may have 
      decreased its metabolism. The combination of these two effects may increase the 
      risk of dose dependent neutropenia. Using the Interaction Probability Scale 
      (DIPS), the interaction was designated as probable. CONCLUSIONS: Until further 
      evidence is available, when fenofibrate is started in a renal transplant patient 
      on mycophenolate careful monitoring should be considered to avoid potentially 
      fatal complications.

AB  - In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung 
      complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002-2003 
      epidemic. This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. 
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on 
      its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S 
      protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease 
      or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn 
      increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by 
      decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological 
      antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung 
      interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with 
      release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, 
      leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of 
      agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating 
      COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the 
      authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the 
      basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an 
      open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan 
      in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).

AB  - We developed three ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass 
      spectrometry detection (UHPLC-MS/MS) methods to quantify 25 antihypertensive 
      drugs in serum samples. Patient-reported drug lists were collected, and drug 
      concentrations were analysed in samples from 547 patients, half with uncontrolled 
      hypertension, and all treated with ≥ 2 antihypertensive drugs. For sample 
      preparation, serum was mixed with deuterated internal standards and acetonitrile 
      and precipitated. Aliquots of the supernatant were injected on UHPLC-MSMS with a 
      C18 reversed phase column. The mobile phase was 0.1 % HCOOH (formic acid) in 
      water and 0.1 % HCOOH in acetonitrile (except in methanol for 
      spironolactone/canrenone) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The calibrators and 
      internal controls were prepared in Autonorm™. The calibration ranges were wide, 
      and the models were linear or quadratic with squared correlation coefficients 
      ≥ 0.97. The limits of detection and quantification, specificity, carry-over, and 
      matrix effects were acceptable. The accuracy of the internal controls was in the 
      range 85-121 %, and the intermediate precision for all drugs was 4-28 %. The 
      patient-reported antihypertensive drug use and the detected serum drug 
      concentrations were in accordance with that most frequently prescribed 
      nationally. The percent non-detectable level was 5-10 % for bendroflumethiazide, 
      doxazosin, nifedipine, and ramipril. Often the drug dose chosen was lower than 
      the recommended maximum daily dose. We report the maximum (C(max)) and minimum 
      (C(min)) drug concentrations after drug intake. The inter-individual 
      pharmacokinetic variability at C(min) was 18-fold for hydrochlorothiazide, 
      22-fold for losartan carboxyl acid, 26-fold for amlodipine, 44-fold for 
      candesartan, and 50-fold for valsartan. Our methods are suitable for measuring 
      antihypertensive drugs in patient serum for therapy control.

      Renal Fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal fibrosis is a common pathological outcome of chronic kidney 
      diseases (CKD) that is considered as a global public health issue with high 
      morbidity and mortality. The dry corolla of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. (AMC) 
      has been used for chronic nephritis in clinic and showed a superior effect in 
      alleviating proteinuria in CKD patients to losartan. However, the effective 
      components and underlying mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis 
      have not been systematically clarified. METHODS: Based on drug-likeness 
      evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction and compound contents, a systematic 
      network pharmacology analysis was conducted to predict the active ingredients. 
      Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and 
      protein-protein interaction analysis were applied to predict the potential 
      pathway and target of AMC against renal fibrosis. The formula of component 
      contribution index (CI) based on the algorithm was used to screen the principal 
      active compounds of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis. Finally, 
      pharmacological evaluation was conducted to validate the protective effect and 
      primary predicted mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis on a 5/6 
      nephrectomy mice model. RESULTS: Fourteen potential active components of AMC 
      possessing favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and biological activities were 
      selected and hit by 17 targets closely related to renal fibrosis. Quercetin, 
      caffeic acid, 9.12-octadecadienoic acid, and myricetin are recognized as the more 
      highly predictive components as their cumulative contribution rate reached 
      85.86%. The AMC administration on 5/6 nephrectomy mice showed a protective effect 
      on kidney function and renal fibrosis. The hub genes analysis revealed that AMC 
      plays a major role in inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during 
      renal fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Our results predicted active components and potential 
      targets of AMC for the application to renal fibrosis from a holistic perspective, 
      as well as provided valuable direction for further research of AMC and improved 
      comprehension of renal fibrosis pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of herbal medicines has tremendously increased over the past 
      few decades. Case reports and controlled clinical investigations of herbal-drug 
      interactions have been reported. Since Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an 
      important role in drug interactions. The evaluation of the influence of herbal 
      medicines on the activities of CYPs is beneficial to promote scientific and 
      rational clinical use of herbal medicines. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to develop 
      and validate a method to simultaneously quantify seven CYP cocktail probe drugs 
      consisting of phenacetin (PNC), bupropion (BPP), losartan potassium (LK), 
      omeprazole (OMP), dextromethorphan (DM), chlorzoxazone (CZZ) and midazolam (MDZ) 
      and their respective metabolites in a single acquisition run and use this method 
      to evaluate the influence of Zhuanggu Guanjie Pill (ZGGJP) on seven CYPs. 
      METHODS: A cost-effective and simple UHPLC-(±)ESI-MS/MS method for simultaneous 
      determination of seven probe drugs and metabolites in rat plasma was developed 
      and validated. Male and female rats were randomly divided into three groups and 
      treated with 1.2 g/kg/d ZGGJP, 5 g/kg/d ZGGJP and 0.5% CMC-Na for 14 consecutive 
      days. After 24 h of the last administration, all rats were administrated orally 
      with probe drugs. The influence of ZGGJP on the CYPs was carried out by comparing 
      the metabolic ratio (C(max), AUC(0-t)) of metabolites/probe drugs in rats. 
      RESULTS: The calibration curves were linear, with correlation coefficient > 0.99 
      for seven probe drugs and their corresponding metabolites. Intra- and inter-day 
      precisions were not greater than 15% RSD and the accuracies were within ± 15% of 
      nominal concentrations. The ZGGJP showed significant inductive effect on CYP1A2, 
      CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A in male and female rats. CONCLUSION: ZGGJP had inductive 
      effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A in male and female rats.

TI  - Evaluation of the potential for drug-induced liver injury based on in vitro 
      covalent binding to human liver proteins.
PG  - 2383-92
LID - 10.1124/dmd.109.028860 [doi]
AB  - Prediction of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is difficult, and 
      the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. However, many drugs causing 
      DILI are considered to form reactive metabolites and covalently bind to cellular 
      macromolecules in the liver. The objective of this study was to clarify whether 
      the risk of idiosyncratic DILI can be estimated by comparing in vitro covalent 
      binding (CB) levels among 12 positive compounds (acetaminophen, alpidem, 
      bromfenac, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flutamide, imipramine, nefazodone, tacrine, 
      ticlopidine, tienilic acid, and troglitazone) for DILI and 12 negative compounds 
      (acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dexamethasone, losartan, ibuprofen, paroxetine, 
      pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, sertraline, theophylline, venlafaxine, and 
      zolpidem). After incubation with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH, 
      there was a large overlap in the distribution of CB amounts between the positive 
      and negative groups. On addition of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) as a cofactor for 
      glucuronidation, the CB levels of bromfenac and diclofenac were increased. With 
      addition of nucleophilic glutathione (GSH), values for most compounds were 
      decreased. However, separation of the two groups on the basis of CB could not be 
      improved by UDPGA or GSH. Furthermore, CB with human hepatocytes also failed to 
      discriminate positive from negative compounds. Therefore, the CB amount alone is 
      not sufficient for risk assessment of DILI. In contrast, when the CB amount was 
      multiplied by the maximum daily dose, which may reflect maximum hepatic exposure, 
      the two groups did become discriminated. Taken together, our findings suggest 
      that the combination of CB amount and daily dose can estimate the risk of 
      idiosyncratic DILI.

TI  - Assessment of Orally Administered Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol When Coadministered 
      With Cannabidiol on Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
      in Healthy Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2254752
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.54752 [doi]
LID - e2254752
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Controlled clinical laboratory studies have shown that cannabidiol 
      (CBD) can sometimes attenuate or exacerbate the effects of 
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). No studies have evaluated differences in 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Δ9-THC and pharmacodynamics (PD) between orally 
      administered cannabis extracts that vary with respect to Δ9-THC and CBD 
      concentrations. OBJECTIVE: To compare the PK and PD of orally administered 
      Δ9-THC-dominant and CBD-dominant cannabis extracts that contained the same Δ9-THC 
      dose (20 mg). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial 
      was a within-participant, double-blind, crossover study conducted from January 
      2021 to March 2022 at the Johns Hopkins University Behavioral Pharmacology 
      Research Unit, Baltimore, MD. Eighteen healthy adults completed 3 randomized 
      outpatient experimental test sessions that were each separated by at least 1 
      week. INTERVENTIONS: Brownies containing (1) no cannabis extract (ie, placebo); 
      (2) Δ9-THC-dominant extract (20 mg Δ9-THC with no CBD); and (3) CBD-dominant 
      extract (20 mg Δ9-THC + 640 mg CBD) were administered to participants 30 minutes 
      prior to administering a cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe drug cocktail, which 
      consisted of 100 mg caffeine, 20 mg omeprazole, 25 mg losartan, 30 mg 
      dextromethorphan, and 2 mg midazolam. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Change-from-baseline plasma concentrations for Δ9-THC or Δ9-THC metabolites and 
      scores for subjective drug effects, cognitive and psychomotor performance, and 
      vital signs. The area under the plasma vs concentration vs time curve (AUC) and 
      maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were determined. RESULTS: The participant 
      cohort of 18 adults included 11 males (61.1%) and 7 females (38.9%) with a mean 
      (SD) age of 30 (7) years who had not used cannabis for at least 30 days prior to 
      initiation of the study (mean [SD] day since last cannabis use, 86 [66] days). 
      The CYP cocktail + placebo brownie and the CYP cocktail did not affect any PD 
      assessments. Relative to CYP cocktail + Δ9-THC, CYP cocktail + Δ9-THC + CBD 
      produced a higher Cmax and area under the plasma concentration vs time curve for 
      Δ9-THC, 11-OH-Δ9-THC, and Δ9-THC-COOH. The CYP cocktail + Δ9-THC + CBD increased 
      self-reported anxiety, sedation, and memory difficulty, increased heart rate, and 
      produced a more pronounced impairment of cognitive and psychomotor performance 
      compared with both CYP cocktail + Δ9-THC and CYP cocktail + placebo. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of oral Δ9-THC and CBD, stronger 
      adverse effects were elicited from a CBD-dominant cannabis extract compared with 
      a Δ9-THC-dominant cannabis extract at the same Δ9-THC dose, which contradicts 
      common claims that CBD attenuates the adverse effects of Δ9-THC. CBD inhibition 
      of Δ9-THC and 11-OH-Δ9-THC metabolism is the likely mechanism for the differences 
      observed. An improved understanding of cannabinoid-cannabinoid and 
      cannabinoid-drug interactions are needed to inform clinical and regulatory 
      decision-making regarding the therapeutic and nontherapeutic use of cannabis 
      products. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04201197.

TI  - Aliskiren: renin inhibitor for hypertension management.
PG  - 31-47
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.01.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has long been 
      recognized to play a significant role in hypertension pathophysiology. Certain 
      agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular 
      outcomes. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents known 
      as renin inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to discuss the 
      clinical pharmacology of aliskiren and its use in the management of hypertension, 
      as well as potential uses in other cardiovascular disorders. METHODS: 
      Peer-reviewed articles and abstracts were identified from the MEDLINE and Current 
      Contents databases (both 1966-October 1, 2007) using the search terms aliskiren, 
      drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. Citations from available 
      articles were reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at recent 
      professional meetings were also examined. RESULTS: Nine published clinical 
      studies have evaluated the effect of aliskiren in lowering blood pressure in 
      hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive 
      agents. This review summarizes those studies. Patients treated with aliskiren had 
      significantly lower blood pressure compared with patients with mild to moderate 
      hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140-180 mm Hg and diastolic blood 
      pressure [DBP] 95-110 mm Hg) who received placebo. Aliskiren in doses of 75 to 
      300 mg daily produced reductions of SBP (-5.3 to -15.8 mm Hg) and DBP (-5.8 to 
      -12.3 mm Hg); placebo produced reductions of SBP that ranged from -2.85 to -10.0 
      mm Hg and DBP reductions from -3.26 to -8.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05 in all studies 
      between aliskiren and placebo). Aliskiren's blood pressure-lowering effect at 
      doses of 75 to 300 mg daily was comparable to irbesartan 150 mg daily and 
      valsartan 80 to 360 mg daily alone. When aliskiren was added to ramipril, 
      hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan, or valsartan, significant additive 
      blood pressure-lowering effects were reported (P < 0.05 in all clinical trials). 
      The total incidence of adverse events was similar to placebo and other 
      comparative agents, including irbesartan, valsartan, losartan, ramipril, and 
      hydrochlorothiazide. The overall adverse-event rates were 22%, 35% to 52%, 25% to 
      52%, 34% to 55%, and 33% to 52% for aliskiren 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg, 
      respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events included headache, 
      dizziness, and fatigue. Studies with cardiovascular outcomes as end points have 
      not been performed with aliskiren. CONCLUSIONS: Aliskiren is an effective 
      alternative agent for blood pressure management. Before aliskiren can be 
      recommended as a routine first-line agent, however, clinical studies must explore 
      if the blood pressure-lowering effect will translate into improvement in 
      cardiovascular outcomes.
